First Foreword

In the early nineties (it might have been 1992, but it’s hard to
remember when you’re having a good time) I joined a rockand-roll band composed mostly of writers. The Rock Bottom
Remainders were the brainchild of Kathi Kamen Goldmark,
a book publicist and musician from San Francisco. The group
included Dave Barry on lead guitar, Ridley Pearson on bass,
Barbara Kingsolver on keyboards, Robert Fulghum on mandolin, and me on rhythm guitar. There was also a trio of
“chick singers,” à la the Dixie Cups, made up (usually) of
Kathi, Tad Bartimus, and Amy Tan.
The group was intended as a one-shot deal—we would
play two shows at the American Booksellers Convention, get
a few laughs, recapture our misspent youth for three or four
hours, then go our separate ways.
It didn’t happen that way, because the group never quite
broke up. We found that we liked playing together too much
to quit, and with a couple of “ringer” musicians on sax and
drums (plus, in the early days, our musical guru, Al Kooper, at
the heart of the group), we sounded pretty good. You’d pay to
hear us. Not a lot, not U2 or E Street Band prices, but maybe
what the oldtimers call “roadhouse money.” We took the
group on tour, wrote a book about it (my wife took the pho7

Stephen King

tos and danced whenever the spirit took her, which was quite
often), and continue to play now and then, sometimes as The
Remainders, sometimes as Raymond Burr’s Legs. The personnel comes and goes—columnist Mitch Albom has replaced
Barbara on keyboards, and Al doesn’t play with the group anymore ’cause he and Kathi don’t get along—but the core has
remained Kathi, Amy, Ridley, Dave, Mitch Albom, and me
. . . plus Josh Kelly on drums and Erasmo Paolo on sax.
We do it for the music, but we also do it for the companionship. We like each other, and we like having a chance to
talk sometimes about the real job, the day job people are
always telling us not to quit. We are writers, and we never ask
one another where we get our ideas; we know we don’t know.
One night while we were eating Chinese before a gig in
Miami Beach, I asked Amy if there was any one question she
was never asked during the Q-and-A that follows almost every
writer’s talk—that question you never get to answer when
you’re standing in front of a group of author-struck fans and
pretending you don’t put your pants on one leg at a time like
everyone else. Amy paused, thinking it over very carefully,
and then said: “No one ever asks about the language.”
I owe an immense debt of gratitude to her for saying that.
I had been playing with the idea of writing a little book
about writing for a year or more at that time, but had held
back because I didn’t trust my own motivations—why did I
want to write about writing? What made me think I had
anything worth saying?
The easy answer is that someone who has sold as many
books of fiction as I have must have something worthwhile to say
about writing it, but the easy answer isn’t always the truth.
Colonel Sanders sold a hell of a lot of fried chicken, but I’m not
sure anyone wants to know how he made it. If I was going to
8

On Writing

be presumptuous enough to tell people how to write, I felt
there had to be a better reason than my popular success. Put
another way, I didn’t want to write a book, even a short one
like this, that would leave me feeling like either a literary gasbag or a transcendental asshole. There are enough of those
books—and those writers—on the market already, thanks.
But Amy was right: nobody ever asks about the language.
They ask the DeLillos and the Updikes and the Styrons, but
they don’t ask popular novelists. Yet many of us proles also
care about the language, in our humble way, and care passionately about the art and craft of telling stories on paper.
What follows is an attempt to put down, briefly and simply,
how I came to the craft, what I know about it now, and how
it’s done. It’s about the day job; it’s about the language.
This book is dedicated to Amy Tan, who told me in a very
simple and direct way that it was okay to write it.

Second Foreword

This is a short book because most books about writing are
filled with bullshit. Fiction writers, present company included,
don’t understand very much about what they do—not why it
works when it’s good, not why it doesn’t when it’s bad. I figured the shorter the book, the less the bullshit.
One notable exception to the bullshit rule is The Elements of
Style, by William Strunk Jr. and E. B. White. There is little or
no detectable bullshit in that book. (Of course it’s short; at
eighty-five pages it’s much shorter than this one.) I’ll tell you
right now that every aspiring writer should read The Elements
of Style. Rule 17 in the chapter titled Principles of Composition is “Omit needless words.” I will try to do that here.

11

Third Foreword

One rule of the road not directly stated elsewhere in this
book: “The editor is always right.” The corollary is that no
writer will take all of his or her editor’s advice; for all have
sinned and fallen short of editorial perfection. Put another way,
to write is human, to edit is divine. Chuck Verrill edited this
book, as he has so many of my novels. And as usual, Chuck,
you were divine.

I was stunned by Mary Karr’s memoir, The Liars’ Club. Not
just by its ferocity, its beauty, and by her delightful grasp of
the vernacular, but by its totality—she is a woman who
remembers everything about her early years.
I’m not that way. I lived an odd, herky-jerky childhood,
raised by a single parent who moved around a lot in my earliest years and who—I am not completely sure of this—may
have farmed my brother and me out to one of her sisters for
awhile because she was economically or emotionally unable to
cope with us for a time. Perhaps she was only chasing our
father, who piled up all sorts of bills and then did a runout
when I was two and my brother David was four. If so, she
never succeeded in finding him. My mom, Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King, was one of America’s early liberated women, but
not by choice.
Mary Karr presents her childhood in an almost unbroken
panorama. Mine is a fogged-out landscape from which occasional memories appear like isolated trees . . . the kind that
look as if they might like to grab and eat you.
What follows are some of those memories, plus assorted
snapshots from the somewhat more coherent days of my adolescence and young manhood. This is not an autobiography. It
17

Stephen King

is, rather, a kind of curriculum vitae—my attempt to show how
one writer was formed. Not how one writer was made; I don’t
believe writers can be made, either by circumstances or by selfwill (although I did believe those things once). The equipment
comes with the original package. Yet it is by no means
unusual equipment; I believe large numbers of people have at
least some talent as writers and storytellers, and that those talents can be strengthened and sharpened. If I didn’t believe
that, writing a book like this would be a waste of time.
This is how it was for me, that’s all—a disjointed growth
process in which ambition, desire, luck, and a little talent all
played a part. Don’t bother trying to read between the lines,
and don’t look for a through-line. There are no lines—only
snapshots, most out of focus.

–1–
My earliest memory is of imagining I was someone else—
imagining that I was, in fact, the Ringling Brothers Circus
Strongboy. This was at my Aunt Ethelyn and Uncle Oren’s
house in Durham, Maine. My aunt remembers this quite
clearly, and says I was two and a half or maybe three years old.
I had found a cement cinderblock in a corner of the garage
and had managed to pick it up. I carried it slowly across the
garage’s smooth cement floor, except in my mind I was
dressed in an animal skin singlet (probably a leopard skin) and
carrying the cinderblock across the center ring. The vast
crowd was silent. A brilliant blue-white spotlight marked
my remarkable progress. Their wondering faces told the story:
never had they seen such an incredibly strong kid. “And he’s
only two!” someone muttered in disbelief.
18

On Writing

Unknown to me, wasps had constructed a small nest in the
lower half of the cinderblock. One of them, perhaps pissed off
at being relocated, flew out and stung me on the ear. The pain
was brilliant, like a poisonous inspiration. It was the worst
pain I had ever suffered in my short life, but it only held the
top spot for a few seconds. When I dropped the cinderblock
on one bare foot, mashing all five toes, I forgot all about the
wasp. I can’t remember if I was taken to the doctor, and neither can my Aunt Ethelyn (Uncle Oren, to whom the Evil
Cinderblock surely belonged, is almost twenty years dead),
but she remembers the sting, the mashed toes, and my reaction. “How you howled, Stephen!” she said. “You were certainly in fine voice that day.”

–2–
A year or so later, my mother, my brother, and I were in West
De Pere, Wisconsin. I don’t know why. Another of my
mother’s sisters, Cal (a WAAC beauty queen during World
War II), lived in Wisconsin with her convivial beer-drinking
husband, and maybe Mom had moved to be near them. If so,
I don’t remember seeing much of the Weimers. Any of them,
actually. My mother was working, but I can’t remember
what her job was, either. I want to say it was a bakery she
worked in, but I think that came later, when we moved to
Connecticut to live near her sister Lois and her husband (no
beer for Fred, and not much in the way of conviviality, either;
he was a crewcut daddy who was proud of driving his convertible with the top up, God knows why).
There was a stream of babysitters during our Wisconsin
period. I don’t know if they left because David and I were a
19

Stephen King

handful, or because they found better-paying jobs, or
because my mother insisted on higher standards than they
were willing to rise to; all I know is that there were a lot of
them. The only one I remember with any clarity is Eula, or
maybe she was Beulah. She was a teenager, she was as big as
a house, and she laughed a lot. Eula-Beulah had a wonderful
sense of humor, even at four I could recognize that, but it was
a dangerous sense of humor—there seemed to be a potential
thunderclap hidden inside each hand-patting, butt-rocking,
head-tossing outburst of glee. When I see those hiddencamera sequences where real-life babysitters and nannies just
all of a sudden wind up and clout the kids, it’s my days with
Eula-Beulah I always think of.
Was she as hard on my brother David as she was on me? I
don’t know. He’s not in any of these pictures. Besides, he
would have been less at risk from Hurricane Eula-Beulah’s
dangerous winds; at six, he would have been in the first
grade and off the gunnery range for most of the day.
Eula-Beulah would be on the phone, laughing with someone, and beckon me over. She would hug me, tickle me, get
me laughing, and then, still laughing, go upside my head
hard enough to knock me down. Then she would tickle me
with her bare feet until we were both laughing again.
Eula-Beulah was prone to farts—the kind that are both
loud and smelly. Sometimes when she was so afflicted, she
would throw me on the couch, drop her wool-skirted butt on
my face, and let loose. “Pow!” she’d cry in high glee. It was
like being buried in marshgas fireworks. I remember the
dark, the sense that I was suffocating, and I remember laughing. Because, while what was happening was sort of horrible,
it was also sort of funny. In many ways, Eula-Beulah prepared
me for literary criticism. After having a two-hundred-pound
20

On Writing

babysitter fart on your face and yell Pow!, The Village Voice
holds few terrors.
I don’t know what happened to the other sitters, but EulaBeulah was fired. It was because of the eggs. One morning
Eula-Beulah fried me an egg for breakfast. I ate it and asked
for another one. Eula-Beulah fried me a second egg, then
asked if I wanted another one. She had a look in her eye that
said, “You don’t dare eat another one, Stevie.” So I asked for
another one. And another one. And so on. I stopped after
seven, I think—seven is the number that sticks in my mind,
and quite clearly. Maybe we ran out of eggs. Maybe I cried
off. Or maybe Eula-Beulah got scared. I don’t know, but
probably it was good that the game ended at seven. Seven
eggs is quite a few for a four-year-old.
I felt all right for awhile, and then I yarked all over the
floor. Eula-Beulah laughed, then went upside my head, then
shoved me into the closet and locked the door. Pow. If she’d
locked me in the bathroom, she might have saved her job, but
she didn’t. As for me, I didn’t really mind being in the closet.
It was dark, but it smelled of my mother’s Coty perfume, and
there was a comforting line of light under the door.
I crawled to the back of the closet, Mom’s coats and dresses
brushing along my back. I began to belch—long loud belches
that burned like fire. I don’t remember being sick to my
stomach but I must have been, because when I opened my
mouth to let out another burning belch, I yarked again
instead. All over my mother’s shoes. That was the end for
Eula-Beulah. When my mother came home from work that
day, the babysitter was fast asleep on the couch and little
Stevie was locked in the closet, fast asleep with half-digested
fried eggs drying in his hair.

Our stay in West De Pere was neither long nor successful. We
were evicted from our third-floor apartment when a neighbor
spotted my six-year-old brother crawling around on the roof
and called the police. I don’t know where my mother was
when this happened. I don’t know where the babysitter of the
week was, either. I only know that I was in the bathroom,
standing with my bare feet on the heater, watching to see if
my brother would fall off the roof or make it back into the
bathroom okay. He made it back. He is now fifty-five and living in New Hampshire.

–4–
When I was five or six, I asked my mother if she had ever seen
anyone die. Yes, she said, she had seen one person die and had
heard another one. I asked how you could hear a person die
and she told me that it was a girl who had drowned off
Prout’s Neck in the 1920s. She said the girl swam out past the
rip, couldn’t get back in, and began screaming for help. Several men tried to reach her, but that day’s rip had developed
a vicious undertow, and they were all forced back. In the end
they could only stand around, tourists and townies, the
teenager who became my mother among them, waiting for a
rescue boat that never came and listening to that girl scream
until her strength gave out and she went under. Her body
washed up in New Hampshire, my mother said. I asked how
old the girl was. Mom said she was fourteen, then read me a
22

On Writing

comic book and packed me off to bed. On some other day she
told me about the one she saw—a sailor who jumped off the
roof of the Graymore Hotel in Portland, Maine, and landed in
the street.
“He splattered,” my mother said in her most matter-offact tone. She paused, then added, “The stuff that came out
of him was green. I have never forgotten it.”
That makes two of us, Mom.

–5–
Most of the nine months I should have spent in the first
grade I spent in bed. My problems started with the measles—
a perfectly ordinary case—and then got steadily worse. I had
bout after bout of what I mistakenly thought was called
“stripe throat”; I lay in bed drinking cold water and imagining my throat in alternating stripes of red and white (this was
probably not so far wrong).
At some point my ears became involved, and one day my
mother called a taxi (she did not drive) and took me to a doctor too important to make house calls—an ear specialist.
(For some reason I got the idea that this sort of doctor was
called an otiologist.) I didn’t care whether he specialized in
ears or assholes. I had a fever of a hundred and four degrees,
and each time I swallowed, pain lit up the sides of my face like
a jukebox.
The doctor looked in my ears, spending most of his time (I
think) on the left one. Then he laid me down on his examining table. “Lift up a minute, Stevie,” his nurse said, and put a
large absorbent cloth—it might have been a diaper—under
my head, so that my cheek rested on it when I lay back
23

Stephen King

down. I should have guessed that something was rotten in
Denmark. Who knows, maybe I did.
There was a sharp smell of alcohol. A clank as the ear doctor opened his sterilizer. I saw the needle in his hand—it
looked as long as the ruler in my school pencil-box—and
tensed. The ear doctor smiled reassuringly and spoke the lie
for which doctors should be immediately jailed (time of
incarceration to be doubled when the lie is told to a child):
“Relax, Stevie, this won’t hurt.” I believed him.
He slid the needle into my ear and punctured my eardrum
with it. The pain was beyond anything I have ever felt
since—the only thing close was the first month of recovery
after being struck by a van in the summer of 1999. That pain
was longer in duration but not so intense. The puncturing of
my eardrum was pain beyond the world. I screamed. There
was a sound inside my head—a loud kissing sound. Hot fluid
ran out of my ear—it was as if I had started to cry out of the
wrong hole. God knows I was crying enough out of the right
ones by then. I raised my streaming face and looked unbelieving at the ear doctor and the ear doctor’s nurse. Then I
looked at the cloth the nurse had spread over the top third of
the exam table. It had a big wet patch on it. There were fine
tendrils of yellow pus on it as well.
“There,” the ear doctor said, patting my shoulder. “You
were very brave, Stevie, and it’s all over.”
The next week my mother called another taxi, we went
back to the ear doctor’s, and I found myself once more lying
on my side with the absorbent square of cloth under my
head. The ear doctor once again produced the smell of alcohol—a smell I still associate, as I suppose many people do,
with pain and sickness and terror—and with it, the long needle. He once more assured me that it wouldn’t hurt, and I
24

On Writing

once more believed him. Not completely, but enough to be
quiet while the needle slid into my ear.
It did hurt. Almost as much as the first time, in fact. The
smooching sound in my head was louder, too; this time it
was giants kissing (“suckin’ face and rotatin’ tongues,” as we
used to say). “There,” the ear doctor’s nurse said when it was
over and I lay there crying in a puddle of watery pus. “It only
hurts a little, and you don’t want to be deaf, do you? Besides,
it’s all over.”
I believed that for about five days, and then another taxi
came. We went back to the ear doctor’s. I remember the cab
driver telling my mother that he was going to pull over and
let us out if she couldn’t shut that kid up.
Once again it was me on the exam table with the diaper
under my head and my mom out in the waiting room with a
magazine she was probably incapable of reading (or so I like
to imagine). Once again the pungent smell of alcohol and the
doctor turning to me with a needle that looked as long as my
school ruler. Once more the smile, the approach, the assurance that this time it wouldn’t hurt.
Since the repeated eardrum-lancings when I was six, one
of my life’s firmest principles has been this: Fool me once,
shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me three
times, shame on both of us. The third time on the ear doctor’s table I struggled and screamed and thrashed and
fought. Each time the needle came near the side of my face,
I knocked it away. Finally the nurse called my mother in
from the waiting room, and the two of them managed to
hold me long enough for the doctor to get his needle in. I
screamed so long and so loud that I can still hear it. In fact, I
think that in some deep valley of my head that last scream is
still echoing.
25

Stephen King

–6–
In a dull cold month not too long after that—it would have
been January or February of 1954, if I’ve got the sequence
right—the taxi came again. This time the specialist wasn’t
the ear doctor but a throat doctor. Once again my mother sat
in the waiting room, once again I sat on the examining table
with a nurse hovering nearby, and once again there was that
sharp smell of alcohol, an aroma that still has the power to
double my heartbeat in the space of five seconds.
All that appeared this time, however, was some sort of
throat swab. It stung, and it tasted awful, but after the ear
doctor’s long needle it was a walk in the park. The throat
doctor donned an interesting gadget that went around his
head on a strap. It had a mirror in the middle, and a bright
fierce light that shone out of it like a third eye. He looked
down my gullet for a long time, urging me to open wider
until my jaws creaked, but he did not put needles into me
and so I loved him. After awhile he allowed me to close my
mouth and summoned my mother.
“The problem is his tonsils,” the doctor said. “They look
like a cat clawed them. They’ll have to come out.”
At some point after that, I remember being wheeled
under bright lights. A man in a white mask bent over me. He
was standing at the head of the table I was lying on (1953
and 1954 were my years for lying on tables), and to me he
looked upside down.
“Stephen,” he said. “Can you hear me?”
I said I could.

26

On Writing

“I want you to breathe deep,” he said. “When you wake
up, you can have all the ice cream you want.”
He lowered a gadget over my face. In the eye of my memory, it looks like an outboard motor. I took a deep breath, and
everything went black. When I woke up I was indeed allowed
all the ice cream I wanted, which was a fine joke on me
because I didn’t want any. My throat felt swollen and fat. But
it was better than the old needle-in-the-ear trick. Oh yes.
Anything would have been better than the old needle-in-theear trick. Take my tonsils if you have to, put a steel birdcage
on my leg if you must, but God save me from the otiologist.

–7–
That year my brother David jumped ahead to the fourth
grade and I was pulled out of school entirely. I had missed too
much of the first grade, my mother and the school agreed; I
could start it fresh in the fall of the year, if my health was
good.
Most of that year I spent either in bed or housebound. I read
my way through approximately six tons of comic books, progressed to Tom Swift and Dave Dawson (a heroic World War
II pilot whose various planes were always “prop-clawing for
altitude”), then moved on to Jack London’s bloodcurdling animal tales. At some point I began to write my own stories. Imitation preceded creation; I would copy Combat Casey comics
word for word in my Blue Horse tablet, sometimes adding my
own descriptions where they seemed appropriate. “They were
camped in a big dratty farmhouse room,” I might write; it was
another year or two before I discovered that drat and draft were

27

Stephen King

different words. During that same period I remember believing that details were dentals and that a bitch was an extremely
tall woman. A son of a bitch was apt to be a basketball player.
When you’re six, most of your Bingo balls are still floating
around in the draw-tank.
Eventually I showed one of these copycat hybrids to my
mother, and she was charmed—I remember her slightly
amazed smile, as if she was unable to believe a kid of hers
could be so smart—practically a damned prodigy, for God’s
sake. I had never seen that look on her face before—not on
my account, anyway—and I absolutely loved it.
She asked me if I had made the story up myself, and I was
forced to admit that I had copied most of it out of a funnybook. She seemed disappointed, and that drained away much
of my pleasure. At last she handed back my tablet. “Write one
of your own, Stevie,” she said. “Those Combat Casey funnybooks are just junk—he’s always knocking someone’s teeth
out. I bet you could do better. Write one of your own.”

–8–
I remember an immense feeling of possibility at the idea, as if
I had been ushered into a vast building filled with closed
doors and had been given leave to open any I liked. There
were more doors than one person could ever open in a lifetime, I thought (and still think).
I eventually wrote a story about four magic animals who
rode around in an old car, helping out little kids. Their leader
was a large white bunny named Mr. Rabbit Trick. He got to
drive the car. The story was four pages long, laboriously
printed in pencil. No one in it, so far as I can remember,
28

On Writing

jumped from the roof of the Graymore Hotel. When I finished, I gave it to my mother, who sat down in the living
room, put her pocketbook on the floor beside her, and read it
all at once. I could tell she liked it—she laughed in all the
right places—but I couldn’t tell if that was because she liked
me and wanted me to feel good or because it really was good.
“You didn’t copy this one?” she asked when she had finished. I said no, I hadn’t. She said it was good enough to be in
a book. Nothing anyone has said to me since has made me
feel any happier. I wrote four more stories about Mr. Rabbit
Trick and his friends. She gave me a quarter apiece for them
and sent them around to her four sisters, who pitied her a little, I think. They were all still married, after all; their men had
stuck. It was true that Uncle Fred didn’t have much sense of
humor and was stubborn about keeping the top of his convertible up, it was also true that Uncle Oren drank quite a bit
and had dark theories about how the Jews were running the
world, but they were there. Ruth, on the other hand, had
been left holding the baby when Don ran out. She wanted
them to see that he was a talented baby, at least.
Four stories. A quarter apiece. That was the first buck I
made in this business.

–9–
We moved to Stratford, Connecticut. By then I was in the
second grade and stone in love with the pretty teenage girl
who lived next door. She never looked twice at me in the daytime, but at night, as I lay in bed and drifted toward sleep,
we ran away from the cruel world of reality again and again.
My new teacher was Mrs. Taylor, a kind lady with gray Elsa
29

Stephen King

Lanchester–Bride of Frankenstein hair and protruding eyes.
“When we’re talking I always want to cup my hands under
Mrs. Taylor’s peepers in case they fall out,” my mom said.
Our new third-floor apartment was on West Broad Street.
A block down the hill, not far from Teddy’s Market and
across from Burrets Building Materials, was a huge tangled
wilderness area with a junkyard on the far side and a train
track running through the middle. This is one of the places I
keep returning to in my imagination; it turns up in my books
and stories again and again, under a variety of names. The
kids in It called it the Barrens; we called it the jungle. Dave
and I explored it for the first time not long after we had
moved into our new place. It was summer. It was hot. It was
great. We were deep into the green mysteries of this cool new
playground when I was struck by an urgent need to move my
bowels.
“Dave,” I said. “Take me home! I have to push!” (This was
the word we were given for this particular function.)
David didn’t want to hear it. “Go do it in the woods,” he
said. It would take at least half an hour to walk me home,
and he had no intention of giving up such a shining stretch of
time just because his little brother had to take a dump.
“I can’t!” I said, shocked by the idea. “I won’t be able to
wipe!”
“Sure you will,” Dave said. “Wipe yourself with some
leaves. That’s how the cowboys and Indians did it.”
By then it was probably too late to get home, anyway; I
have an idea I was out of options. Besides, I was enchanted
by the idea of shitting like a cowboy. I pretended I was
Hopalong Cassidy, squatting in the underbrush with my gun
drawn, not to be caught unawares even at such a personal
moment. I did my business, and took care of the cleanup as
30

On Writing

my older brother had suggested, carefully wiping my ass
with big handfuls of shiny green leaves. These turned out to
be poison ivy.
Two days later I was bright red from the backs of my knees
to my shoulderblades. My penis was spared, but my testicles
turned into stoplights. My ass itched all the way up to my
ribcage, it seemed. Yet worst of all was the hand I had wiped
with; it swelled to the size of Mickey Mouse’s after Donald
Duck has bopped it with a hammer, and gigantic blisters
formed at the places where the fingers rubbed together. When
they burst they left deep divots of raw pink flesh. For six weeks
I sat in lukewarm starch baths, feeling miserable and humiliated and stupid, listening through the open door as my
mother and brother laughed and listened to Peter Tripp’s
countdown on the radio and played Crazy Eights.

Dave was a great brother, but too smart for a ten-year-old.
His brains were always getting him in trouble, and he learned
at some point (probably after I had wiped my ass with poison
ivy) that it was usually possible to get Brother Stevie to join
him in the point position when trouble was in the wind.
Dave never asked me to shoulder all the blame for his often
brilliant fuck-ups—he was neither a sneak nor a coward—but
on several occasions I was asked to share it. Which was, I
think, why we both got in trouble when Dave dammed up
the stream running through the jungle and flooded much of
lower West Broad Street. Sharing the blame was also the
reason we both ran the risk of getting killed while implementing his potentially lethal school science project.

This was probably 1958. I was at Center Grammar School;
Dave was at Stratford Junior High. Mom was working at the
Stratford Laundry, where she was the only white lady on the
mangle crew. That’s what she was doing—feeding sheets
into the mangle—while Dave constructed his Science Fair
project. My big brother wasn’t the sort of boy to content himself drawing frog-diagrams on construction paper or making
The House of the Future out of plastic Tyco bricks and
painted toilet-tissue rolls; Dave aimed for the stars. His
project that year was Dave’s Super Duper Electromagnet. My
brother had great affection for things which were super duper
and things which began with his own name; this latter habit
culminated with Dave’s Rag, which we will come to shortly.
His first stab at the Super Duper Electromagnet wasn’t
very super duper; in fact, it may not have worked at all—I
don’t remember for sure. It did come out of an actual book,
rather than Dave’s head, however. The idea was this: you
magnetized a spike nail by rubbing it against a regular magnet. The magnetic charge imparted to the spike would be
weak, the book said, but enough to pick up a few iron filings.
After trying this, you were supposed to wrap a length of copper wire around the barrel of the spike, and attach the ends
of the wire to the terminals of a dry-cell battery. According to
the book, the electricity would strengthen the magnetism,
and you could pick up a lot more iron filings.
Dave didn’t just want to pick up a stupid pile of metal
flakes, though; Dave wanted to pick up Buicks, railroad boxcars, possibly Army transport planes. Dave wanted to turn
on the juice and move the world in its orbit.
Pow! Super!
We each had our part to play in creating the Super Duper
Electromagnet. Dave’s part was to build it. My part would
32

On Writing

be to test it. Little Stevie King, Stratford’s answer to Chuck
Yeager.
Dave’s new version of the experiment bypassed the pokey
old dry cell (which was probably flat anyway when we bought
it at the hardware store, he reasoned) in favor of actual wallcurrent. Dave cut the electrical cord off an old lamp someone
had put out on the curb with the trash, stripped the coating
all the way down to the plug, then wrapped his magnetized
spike in spirals of bare wire. Then, sitting on the floor in the
kitchen of our West Broad Street apartment, he offered me
the Super Duper Electromagnet and bade me do my part and
plug it in.
I hesitated—give me at least that much credit—but in the
end, Dave’s manic enthusiasm was too much to withstand. I
plugged it in. There was no noticeable magnetism, but the
gadget did blow out every light and electrical appliance in our
apartment, every light and electrical appliance in the building,
and every light and electrical appliance in the building next
door (where my dream-girl lived in the ground-floor apartment). Something popped in the electrical transformer out
front, and some cops came. Dave and I spent a horrible hour
watching from our mother’s bedroom window, the only one
that looked out on the street (all the others had a good view
of the grassless, turd-studded yard behind us, where the only
living thing was a mangy canine named Roop-Roop). When
the cops left, a power truck arrived. A man in spiked shoes
climbed the pole between the two apartment houses to examine the transformer. Under other circumstances, this would
have absorbed us completely, but not that day. That day we
could only wonder if our mother would come and see us in
reform school. Eventually, the lights came back on and the
power truck went away. We were not caught and lived to
33

Stephen King

fight another day. Dave decided he might build a Super
Duper Glider instead of a Super Duper Electromagnet for his
science project. I, he told me, would get to take the first
ride. Wouldn’t that be great?

I was born in 1947 and we didn’t get our first television until
1958. The first thing I remember watching on it was Robot
Monster, a film in which a guy dressed in an ape-suit with a
goldfish bowl on his head—Ro-Man, he was called—ran
around trying to kill the last survivors of a nuclear war. I felt
this was art of quite a high nature.
I also watched Highway Patrol with Broderick Crawford as
the fearless Dan Matthews, and One Step Beyond, hosted by
John Newland, the man with the world’s spookiest eyes.
There was Cheyenne and Sea Hunt, Your Hit Parade and Annie
Oakley; there was Tommy Rettig as the first of Lassie’s many
friends, Jock Mahoney as The Range Rider, and Andy Devine
yowling, “Hey, Wild Bill, wait for me!” in his odd, high
voice. There was a whole world of vicarious adventure which
came packaged in black-and-white, fourteen inches across
and sponsored by brand names which still sound like poetry
to me. I loved it all.
But TV came relatively late to the King household, and
I’m glad. I am, when you stop to think of it, a member of a
fairly select group: the final handful of American novelists
who learned to read and write before they learned to eat a
daily helping of video bullshit. This might not be important.
On the other hand, if you’re just starting out as a writer, you
could do worse than strip your television’s electric plug-wire,
34

On Writing

wrap a spike around it, and then stick it back into the wall.
See what blows, and how far.
Just an idea.

In the late 1950s, a literary agent and compulsive science fiction memorabilia collector named Forrest J. Ackerman
changed the lives of thousands of kids—I was one—when he
began editing a magazine called Famous Monsters of Filmland.
Ask anyone who has been associated with the fantasy–horror–science fiction genres in the last thirty years about this
magazine, and you’ll get a laugh, a flash of the eyes, and a
stream of bright memories—I practically guarantee it.
Around 1960, Forry (who sometimes referred to himself as
“the Ackermonster”) spun off the short-lived but interesting
Spacemen, a magazine which covered science fiction films. In
1960, I sent a story to Spacemen. It was, as well as I can
remember, the first story I ever submitted for publication. I
don’t recall the title, but I was still in the Ro-Man phase of my
development, and this particular tale undoubtedly owed a
great deal to the killer ape with the goldfish bowl on his
head.
My story was rejected, but Forry kept it. (Forry keeps
everything, which anyone who has ever toured his house—the
Ackermansion—will tell you.) About twenty years later, while
I was signing autographs at a Los Angeles bookstore, Forry
turned up in line . . . with my story, single-spaced and typed
with the long-vanished Royal typewriter my mom gave me for
Christmas the year I was eleven. He wanted me to sign it to
him, and I guess I did, although the whole encounter was so
35

Stephen King

surreal I can’t be completely sure. Talk about your ghosts. Man
oh man.

– 13 –
The first story I did actually publish was in a horror fanzine
issued by Mike Garrett of Birmingham, Alabama (Mike is
still around, and still in the biz). He published this novella
under the title “In a Half-World of Terror,” but I still like
my title much better. Mine was “I Was a Teen-Age Graverobber.” Super Duper! Pow!

– 14 –
My first really original story idea—you always know the first
one, I think—came near the end of Ike’s eight-year reign of
benignity. I was sitting at the kitchen table of our house in
Durham, Maine, and watching my mother stick sheets of
S&H Green Stamps into a book. (For more colorful stories
about Green Stamps, see The Liars’ Club.) Our little family
troika had moved back to Maine so our mom could take care
of her parents in their declining years. Mama was about
eighty at that time, obese and hypertensive and mostly blind;
Daddy Guy was eighty-two, scrawny, morose, and prone to
the occasional Donald Duck outburst which only my mother
could understand. Mom called Daddy Guy “Fazza.”
My mother’s sisters had gotten my mom this job, perhaps
thinking they could kill two birds with one stone—the aged
Ps would be taken care of in a homey environment by a loving daughter, and The Nagging Problem of Ruth would be
36

On Writing

solved. She would no longer be adrift, trying to take care of
two boys while she floated almost aimlessly from Indiana to
Wisconsin to Connecticut, baking cookies at five in the
morning or pressing sheets in a laundry where the temperatures often soared to a hundred and ten in the summer and
the foreman gave out salt pills at one and three every afternoon from July to the end of September.
She hated her new job, I think—in their effort to take care
of her, her sisters turned our self-sufficient, funny, slightly
nutty mother into a sharecropper living a largely cashless existence. The money the sisters sent her each month covered the
groceries but little else. They sent boxes of clothes for us.
Toward the end of each summer, Uncle Clayt and Aunt Ella
(who were not, I think, real relatives at all) would bring cartons of canned vegetables and preserves. The house we lived in
belonged to Aunt Ethelyn and Uncle Oren. And once she was
there, Mom was caught. She got another actual job after the
old folks died, but she lived in that house until the cancer got
her. When she left Durham for the last time—David and his
wife Linda cared for her during the final weeks of her final illness—I have an idea she was probably more than ready to go.

– 15 –
Let’s get one thing clear right now, shall we? There is no Idea
Dump, no Story Central, no Island of the Buried Bestsellers;
good story ideas seem to come quite literally from nowhere,
sailing at you right out of the empty sky: two previously
unrelated ideas come together and make something new
under the sun. Your job isn’t to find these ideas but to recognize them when they show up.
37

Stephen King

On the day this particular idea—the first really good
one—came sailing at me, my mother remarked that she
needed six more books of stamps to get a lamp she wanted to
give her sister Molly for Christmas, and she didn’t think she
would make it in time. “I guess it will have to be for her
birthday, instead,” she said. “These cussed things always look
like a lot until you stick them in a book.” Then she crossed
her eyes and ran her tongue out at me. When she did, I saw
her tongue was S&H green. I thought how nice it would be if
you could make those damned stamps in your basement, and
in that instant a story called “Happy Stamps” was born. The
concept of counterfeiting Green Stamps and the sight of my
mother’s green tongue created it in an instant.
The hero of my story was your classic Poor Schmuck, a
guy named Roger who had done jail time twice for counterfeiting money—one more bust would make him a threetime loser. Instead of money, he began to counterfeit Happy
Stamps . . . except, he discovered, the design of Happy
Stamps was so moronically simple that he wasn’t really counterfeiting at all; he was creating reams of the actual article. In
a funny scene—probably the first really competent scene I
ever wrote—Roger sits in the living room with his old mom,
the two of them mooning over the Happy Stamps catalogue
while the printing press runs downstairs, ejecting bale after
bale of those same trading stamps.
“Great Scott!” Mom says. “According to the fine print,
you can get anything with Happy Stamps, Roger—you tell
them what you want, and they figure out how many books
you need to get it. Why, for six or seven million books, we
could probably get a Happy Stamps house in the suburbs!”
Roger discovers, however, that although the stamps are
perfect, the glue is defective. If you lap the stamps and stick
38

On Writing

them in the book they’re fine, but if you send them through
a mechanical licker, the pink Happy Stamps turn blue. At the
end of the story, Roger is in the basement, standing in front of
a mirror. Behind him, on the table, are roughly ninety books
of Happy Stamps, each book filled with individually licked
sheets of stamps. Our hero’s lips are pink. He runs out his
tongue; that’s even pinker. Even his teeth are turning pink.
Mom calls cheerily down the stairs, saying she has just gotten
off the phone with the Happy Stamps National Redemption
Center in Terre Haute, and the lady said they could probably
get a nice Tudor home in Weston for only eleven million, six
hundred thousand books of Happy Stamps.
“That’s nice, Mom,” Roger says. He looks at himself a
moment longer in the mirror, lips pink and eyes bleak, then
slowly returns to the table. Behind him, billions of Happy
Stamps are stuffed into basement storage bins. Slowly, our
hero opens a fresh stamp-book, then begins to lick sheets and
stick them in. Only eleven million, five hundred and ninety
thousand books to go, he thinks as the story ends, and Mom
can have her Tudor.
There were things wrong with this story (the biggest hole
was probably Roger’s failure simply to start over with a different glue), but it was cute, it was fairly original, and I knew
I had done some pretty good writing. After a long time spent
studying the markets in my beat-up Writer’s Digest, I sent
“Happy Stamps” off to Alfred Hitchcock’s Mystery Magazine. It
came back three weeks later with a form rejection slip
attached. This slip bore Alfred Hitchcock’s unmistakable
profile in red ink and wished me good luck with my story. At
the bottom was an unsigned jotted message, the only personal response I got from AHMM over eight years of periodic
submissions. “Don’t staple manuscripts,” the postscript read.
39

Stephen King

“Loose pages plus paperclip equal correct way to submit
copy.” This was pretty cold advice, I thought, but useful in
its way. I have never stapled a manuscript since.

– 16 –
My room in our Durham house was upstairs, under the eaves.
At night I could lie in bed beneath one of these eaves—if I sat
up suddenly, I was apt to whack my head a good one—and
read by the light of a gooseneck lamp that put an amusing
boa constrictor of shadow on the ceiling. Sometimes the
house was quiet except for the whoosh of the furnace and the
patter of rats in the attic; sometimes my grandmother would
spend an hour or so around midnight yelling for someone to
check Dick—she was afraid he hadn’t been fed. Dick, a horse
she’d had in her days as a schoolteacher, was at least forty
years dead. I had a desk beneath the room’s other eave, my
old Royal typewriter, and a hundred or so paperback books,
mostly science fiction, which I lined up along the baseboard.
On my bureau was a Bible won for memorizing verses in
Methodist Youth Fellowship and a Webcor phonograph with
an automatic changer and a turntable covered in soft green
velvet. On it I played my records, mostly 45s by Elvis, Chuck
Berry, Freddy Cannon, and Fats Domino. I liked Fats; he
knew how to rock, and you could tell he was having fun.
When I got the rejection slip from AHMM, I pounded a
nail into the wall above the Webcor, wrote “Happy Stamps”
on the rejection slip, and poked it onto the nail. Then I sat on
my bed and listened to Fats sing “I’m Ready.” I felt pretty
good, actually. When you’re still too young to shave, optimism is a perfectly legitimate response to failure.
40

On Writing

By the time I was fourteen (and shaving twice a week
whether I needed to or not) the nail in my wall would no
longer support the weight of the rejection slips impaled upon
it. I replaced the nail with a spike and went on writing. By the
time I was sixteen I’d begun to get rejection slips with handwritten notes a little more encouraging than the advice to stop
using staples and start using paperclips. The first of these hopeful notes was from Algis Budrys, then the editor of Fantasy and
Science Fiction, who read a story of mine called “The Night of
the Tiger” (the inspiration was, I think, an episode of The Fugitive in which Dr. Richard Kimble worked as an attendant
cleaning out cages in a zoo or a circus) and wrote: “This is
good. Not for us, but good. You have talent. Submit again.”
Those four brief sentences, scribbled by a fountain pen
that left big ragged blotches in its wake, brightened the dismal winter of my sixteenth year. Ten years or so later, after
I’d sold a couple of novels, I discovered “The Night of the
Tiger” in a box of old manuscripts and thought it was still a
perfectly respectable tale, albeit one obviously written by a
guy who had only begun to learn his chops. I rewrote it and
on a whim resubmitted it to F&SF. This time they bought
it. One thing I’ve noticed is that when you’ve had a little
success, magazines are a lot less apt to use that phrase, “Not
for us.”

– 17 –
Although he was a year younger than his classmates, my big
brother was bored with high school. Some of this had to do
with his intellect—Dave’s IQ tested in the 150s or 160s—
but I think it was mostly his restless nature. For Dave, high
41

Stephen King

school just wasn’t super duper enough—there was no pow,
no wham, no fun. He solved the problem, at least temporarily, by creating a newspaper which he called Dave’s Rag.
The Rag’s office was a table located in the dirt-floored,
rock-walled, spider-infested confines of our basement, somewhere north of the furnace and east of the root-cellar, where
Clayt and Ella’s endless cartons of preserves and canned vegetables were kept. The Rag was an odd combination of family newsletter and small-town bi-weekly. Sometimes it was a
monthly, if Dave got sidetracked by other interests (maplesugaring, cider-making, rocket-building, and car-customizing,
just to name a few), and then there would be jokes I didn’t
understand about how Dave’s Rag was a little late this month
or how we shouldn’t bother Dave, because he was down in the
basement, on the Rag.
Jokes or no jokes, circulation rose slowly from about five
copies per issue (sold to nearby family members) to something like fifty or sixty, with our relatives and the relatives of
neighbors in our small town (Durham’s population in 1962
was about nine hundred) eagerly awaiting each new edition.
A typical number would let people know how Charley Harrington’s broken leg was mending, what guest speakers
might be coming to the West Durham Methodist Church,
how much water the King boys were hauling from the town
pump to keep from draining the well behind the house (of
course it went dry every fucking summer no matter how
much water we hauled), who was visiting the Browns or the
Halls on the other side of Methodist Corners, and whose relatives were due to hit town each summer. Dave also included
sports, word-games, weather reports (“It’s been pretty dry,
but local farmer Harold Davis says if we don’t have at least
one good rain in August he will smile and kiss a pig”),
42

On Writing

recipes, a continuing story (I wrote that), and Dave’s Jokes
and Humor, which included nuggets like these:
Stan: “What did the beaver say to the oak tree?”
Jan: “It was nice gnawing you!”
1st Beatnik: “How do you get to Carnegie Hall?”
2nd Beatnik: “Practice man practice!”
During the Rag’s first year, the print was purple—those
issues were produced on a flat plate of jelly called a hectograph. My brother quickly decided the hectograph was a
pain in the butt. It was just too slow for him. Even as a kid in
short pants, Dave hated to be halted. Whenever Milt, our
mom’s boyfriend (“Sweeter than smart,” Mom said to me
one day a few months after she dropped him), got stuck in
traffic or at a stoplight, Dave would lean over from the back
seat of Milt’s Buick and yell, “Drive over em, Uncle Milt!
Drive over em!”
As a teenager, waiting for the hectograph to “freshen”
between pages printed (while “freshening,” the print would
melt into a vague purple membrane which hung in the jelly
like a manatee’s shadow) drove David all but insane with
impatience. Also, he badly wanted to add photographs to the
newspaper. He took good ones, and by age sixteen he was
developing them, as well. He rigged a darkroom in a closet
and from its tiny, chemical-stinking confines produced pictures which were often startling in their clarity and composition (the photo on the back of The Regulators, showing me
with a copy of the magazine containing my first published
story, was taken by Dave with an old Kodak and developed in
his closet darkroom).
43

Stephen King

In addition to these frustrations, the flats of hectograph
jelly had a tendency to incubate and support colonies of
strange, sporelike growths in the unsavory atmosphere of our
basement, no matter how meticulous we were about covering the damned old slowcoach thing once the day’s printing
chores were done. What looked fairly ordinary on Monday
sometimes looked like something out of an H. P. Lovecraft
horror tale by the weekend.
In Brunswick, where he went to high school, Dave found
a shop with a small drum printing press for sale. It worked—
barely. You typed up your copy on stencils which could be
purchased in a local office-supply store for nineteen cents
apiece—my brother called this chore “cutting stencil,” and it
was usually my job, as I was less prone to make typing errors.
The stencils were attached to the drum of the press, lathered
up with the world’s stinkiest, oogiest ink, and then you were
off to the races—crank ’til your arm falls off, son. We were
able to put together in two nights what had previously taken
a week with the hectograph, and while the drum-press was
messy, it did not look infected with a potentially fatal disease.
Dave’s Rag entered its brief golden age.

– 18 –
I wasn’t much interested in the printing process, and I wasn’t
interested at all in the arcana of first developing and then
reproducing photographs. I didn’t care about putting Hearst
shifters in cars, making cider, or seeing if a certain formula
would send a plastic rocket into the stratosphere (usually
they didn’t even make it over the house). What I cared about
most between 1958 and 1966 was movies.
44

On Writing

As the fifties gave way to the sixties, there were only two
movie theaters in the area, both in Lewiston. The Empire was
the first-run house, showing Disney pictures, Bible epics,
and musicals in which widescreen ensembles of well-scrubbed
folks danced and sang. I went to these if I had a ride—a
movie was a movie, after all—but I didn’t like them very
much. They were boringly wholesome. They were predictable. During The Parent Trap, I kept hoping Hayley Mills
would run into Vic Morrow from The Blackboard Jungle. That
would have livened things up a little, by God. I felt that one
look at Vic’s switchblade knife and gimlet gaze would have
put Hayley’s piddling domestic problems in some kind of reasonable perspective. And when I lay in bed at night under my
eave, listening to the wind in the trees or the rats in the
attic, it was not Debbie Reynolds as Tammy or Sandra Dee as
Gidget that I dreamed of, but Yvette Vickers from Attack of
the Giant Leeches or Luana Anders from Dementia 13. Never
mind sweet; never mind uplifting; never mind Snow White
and the Seven Goddam Dwarfs. At thirteen I wanted monsters that ate whole cities, radioactive corpses that came out of
the ocean and ate surfers, and girls in black bras who looked
like trailer trash.
Horror movies, science fiction movies, movies about
teenage gangs on the prowl, movies about losers on motorcycles—this was the stuff that turned my dials up to ten. The
place to get all of this was not at the Empire, on the upper
end of Lisbon Street, but at the Ritz, down at the lower end,
amid the pawnshops and not far from Louie’s Clothing, where
in 1964 I bought my first pair of Beatle boots. The distance
from my house to the Ritz was fourteen miles, and I hitchhiked there almost every weekend during the eight years
between 1958 and 1966, when I finally got my driver’s
45

Stephen King

license. Sometimes I went with my friend Chris Chesley,
sometimes I went alone, but unless I was sick or something,
I always went. It was at the Ritz that I saw I Married a Monster from Outer Space, with Tom Tryon; The Haunting, with
Claire Bloom and Julie Harris; The Wild Angels, with Peter
Fonda and Nancy Sinatra. I saw Olivia de Havilland put out
James Caan’s eyes with makeshift knives in Lady in a Cage,
saw Joseph Cotten come back from the dead in Hush . . .
Hush, Sweet Charlotte, and watched with held breath (and not
a little prurient interest) to see if Allison Hayes would grow all
the way out of her clothes in Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman. At the
Ritz, all the finer things in life were available . . . or might be
available, if you only sat in the third row, paid close attention,
and did not blink at the wrong moment.
Chris and I liked just about any horror movie, but our faves
were the string of American-International films, most directed
by Roger Corman, with titles cribbed from Edgar Allan Poe.
I wouldn’t say based upon the works of Edgar Allan Poe,
because there is little in any of them which has anything to do
with Poe’s actual stories and poems (The Raven was filmed as
a comedy—no kidding). And yet the best of them—The
Haunted Palace, The Conqueror Worm, The Masque of the Red
Death—achieved a hallucinatory eeriness that made them
special. Chris and I had our own name for these films, one
that made them into a separate genre. There were westerns,
there were love stories, there were war stories . . . and there
were Poepictures.
“Wanna hitch to the show Saturday afternoon?” Chris
would ask. “Go to the Ritz?”
“What’s on?” I’d ask.
“A motorcycle picture and a Poepicture,” he’d say. I, of
course, was on that combo like white on rice. Bruce Dern

On Writing

going batshit on a Harley and Vincent Price going batshit in
a haunted castle overlooking a restless ocean: who could ask
for more? You might even get Hazel Court wandering
around in a lacy low-cut nightgown, if you were lucky.
Of all the Poepictures, the one that affected Chris and me
the most deeply was The Pit and the Pendulum. Written by
Richard Matheson and filmed in both widescreen and Technicolor (color horror pictures were still a rarity in 1961, when
this one came out), Pit took a bunch of standard gothic ingredients and turned them into something special. It might
have been the last really great studio horror picture before
George Romero’s ferocious indie The Night of the Living Dead
came along and changed everything forever (in some few
cases for the better, in most for the worse). The best scene—
the one which froze Chris and me into our seats—depicted
John Kerr digging into a castle wall and discovering the
corpse of his sister, who was obviously buried alive. I have
never forgotten the corpse’s close-up, shot through a red filter and a distorting lens which elongated the face into a huge
silent scream.
On the long hitch home that night (if rides were slow in
coming, you might end up walking four or five miles and not
get home until well after dark) I had a wonderful idea: I
would turn The Pit and the Pendulum into a book! Would novelize it, as Monarch Books had novelized such undying film
classics as Jack the Ripper, Gorgo, and Konga. But I wouldn’t just
write this masterpiece; I would also print it, using the drumpress in our basement, and sell copies at school! Zap! Ka-pow!
As it was conceived, so was it done. Working with the care
and deliberation for which I would later be critically acclaimed,
I turned out my “novel version” of The Pit and the Pendulum in
two days, composing directly onto the stencils from which I’d
47

Stephen King

print. Although no copies of that particular masterpiece survive (at least to my knowledge), I believe it was eight pages
long, each page single-spaced and paragraph breaks kept to an
absolute minimum (each stencil cost nineteen cents, remember). I printed sheets on both sides, just as in a standard
book, and added a title page on which I drew a rudimentary
pendulum dripping small black blotches which I hoped would
look like blood. At the last moment I realized I had forgotten
to identify the publishing house. After a half-hour or so of
pleasant mulling, I typed the words A V.I.B. BOOK in the
upper right corner of my title page. V.I.B. stood for Very
Important Book.
I ran off about forty copies of The Pit and the Pendulum,
blissfully unaware that I was in violation of every plagiarism
and copyright statute in the history of the world; my thoughts
were focused almost entirely on how much money I might
make if my story was a hit at school. The stencils had cost me
$1.71 (having to use up one whole stencil for the title page
seemed a hideous waste of money, but you had to look good,
I’d reluctantly decided; you had to go out there with a bit of
the old attitude), the paper had cost another two bits or so,
the staples were free, cribbed from my brother (you might
have to paperclip stories you were sending out to magazines,
but this was a book, this was the bigtime). After some further
thought, I priced V.I.B. #1, The Pit and the Pendulum by
Steve King, at a quarter a copy. I thought I might be able to
sell ten (my mother would buy one to get me started; she
could always be counted on), and that would add up to
$2.50. I’d make about forty cents, which would be enough to
finance another educational trip to the Ritz. If I sold two
more, I could get a big sack of popcorn and a Coke, as well.
The Pit and the Pendulum turned out to be my first best48

On Writing

seller. I took the entire print-run to school in my book-bag (in
1961 I would have been an eighth-grader at Durham’s newly
built four-room elementary school), and by noon that day I
had sold two dozen. By the end of lunch hour, when word had
gotten around about the lady buried in the wall (“They stared
with horror at the bones sticking out from the ends of her fingers, realizing she had died scratcheing madley for escape”), I
had sold three dozen. I had nine dollars in change weighing
down the bottom of my book-bag (upon which Durham’s
answer to Daddy Cool had carefully printed most of the lyrics
to “The Lion Sleeps Tonight”) and was walking around in a
kind of dream, unable to believe my sudden ascension to
previously unsuspected realms of wealth. It all seemed too
good to be true.
It was. When the school day ended at two o’clock, I was
summoned to the principal’s office, where I was told I couldn’t
turn the school into a marketplace, especially not, Miss Hisler
said, to sell such trash as The Pit and the Pendulum. Her attitude
didn’t much surprise me. Miss Hisler had been the teacher at
my previous school, the one-roomer at Methodist Corners,
where I went to the fifth and sixth grades. During that time
she had spied me reading a rather sensational “teenage rumble” novel (The Amboy Dukes, by Irving Shulman), and had
taken it away. This was just more of the same, and I was disgusted with myself for not seeing the outcome in advance. In
those days we called someone who did an idiotic thing a dubber (pronounced dubba if you were from Maine). I had just
dubbed up bigtime.
“What I don’t understand, Stevie,” she said, “is why you’d
write junk like this in the first place. You’re talented. Why do
you want to waste your abilities?” She had rolled up a copy of
V.I.B. #1 and was brandishing it at me the way a person
49

Stephen King

might brandish a rolled-up newspaper at a dog that has piddled on the rug. She waited for me to answer—to her credit,
the question was not entirely rhetorical—but I had no answer
to give. I was ashamed. I have spent a good many years
since—too many, I think—being ashamed about what I
write. I think I was forty before I realized that almost every
writer of fiction and poetry who has ever published a line has
been accused by someone of wasting his or her God-given talent. If you write (or paint or dance or sculpt or sing, I suppose), someone will try to make you feel lousy about it, that’s
all. I’m not editorializing, just trying to give you the facts as
I see them.
Miss Hisler told me I would have to give everyone’s money
back. I did so with no argument, even to those kids (and there
were quite a few, I’m happy to say) who insisted on keeping
their copies of V.I.B. #1. I ended up losing money on the deal
after all, but when summer vacation came I printed four
dozen copies of a new story, an original called The Invasion of
the Star-Creatures, and sold all but four or five. I guess that
means I won in the end, at least in a financial sense. But in my
heart I stayed ashamed. I kept hearing Miss Hisler asking why
I wanted to waste my talent, why I wanted to waste my
time, why I wanted to write junk.

Doing a serial story for Dave’s Rag was fun, but my other journalistic duties bored me. Still, I had worked for a newspaper
of sorts, word got around, and during my sophomore year at
Lisbon High I became editor of our school newspaper, The
Drum. I don’t recall being given any choice in this matter; I
50

On Writing

think I was simply appointed. My second-in-command,
Danny Emond, had even less interest in the paper than I
did. Danny just liked the idea that Room 4, where we did our
work, was near the girls’ bathroom. “Someday I’ll just go
crazy and hack my way in there, Steve,” he told me on more
than one occasion. “Hack, hack, hack.” Once he added, perhaps in an effort to justify himself: “The prettiest girls in
school pull up their skirts in there.” This struck me as so fundamentally stupid it might actually be wise, like a Zen koan
or an early story by John Updike.
The Drum did not prosper under my editorship. Then as
now, I tend to go through periods of idleness followed by periods of workaholic frenzy. In the schoolyear 1963–1964, The
Drum published just one issue, but that one was a monster
thicker than the Lisbon Falls telephone book. One night—
sick to death of Class Reports, Cheerleading Updates, and
some lamebrain’s efforts to write a school poem—I created a
satiric high school newspaper of my own when I should have
been captioning photographs for The Drum. What resulted
was a four-sheet which I called The Village Vomit. The boxed
motto in the upper lefthand corner was not “All the News
That’s Fit to Print” but “All the Shit That Will Stick.” That
piece of dimwit humor got me into the only real trouble of my
high school career. It also led me to the most useful writing
lesson I ever got.
In typical Mad magazine style (“What, me worry?”), I
filled the Vomit with fictional tidbits about the LHS faculty,
using teacher nicknames the student body would immediately recognize. Thus Miss Raypach, the study-hall monitor,
became Miss Rat Pack; Mr. Ricker, the college-track English
teacher (and the school’s most urbane faculty member—he
looked quite a bit like Craig Stevens in Peter Gunn), became
51

Stephen King

Cow Man because his family owned Ricker Dairy; Mr. Diehl,
the earth-science teacher, became Old Raw Diehl.
As all sophomoric humorists must be, I was totally blown
away by my own wit. What a funny fellow I was! A regular
mill-town H. L. Mencken! I simply must take the Vomit to
school and show all my friends! They would bust a collective
gut!
As a matter of fact, they did bust a collective gut; I had
some good ideas about what tickled the funnybones of high
school kids, and most of them were showcased in The Village
Vomit. In one article, Cow Man’s prize Jersey won a livestock
farting contest at Topsham Fair; in another, Old Raw Diehl
was fired for sticking the eyeballs of specimen fetal pigs up
his nostrils. Humor in the grand Swiftian manner, you see.
Pretty sophisticated, eh?
During period four, three of my friends were laughing so
hard in the back of study-hall that Miss Raypach (Rat Pack to
you, chum) crept up on them to see what was so funny. She
confiscated The Village Vomit, on which I had, either out of overweening pride or almost unbelievable naiveté, put my name as
Editor in Chief & Grand High Poobah, and at the close of
school I was for the second time in my student career summoned to the office on account of something I had written.
This time the trouble was a good deal more serious. Most
of the teachers were inclined to be good sports about my
teasing—even Old Raw Diehl was willing to let bygones be
bygones concerning the pigs’ eyeballs—but one was not.
This was Miss Margitan, who taught shorthand and typing to
the girls in the business courses. She commanded both respect
and fear; in the tradition of teachers from an earlier era, Miss
Margitan did not want to be your pal, your psychologist, or
your inspiration. She was there to teach business skills, and
52

On Writing

she wanted all learning to be done by the rules. Her rules.
Girls in Miss Margitan’s classes were sometimes asked to
kneel on the floor, and if the hems of their skirts didn’t touch
the linoleum, they were sent home to change. No amount of
tearful begging could soften her, no reasoning could modify
her view of the world. Her detention lists were the longest of
any teacher in the school, but her girls were routinely selected
as valedictorians or salutatorians and usually went on to good
jobs. Many came to love her. Others loathed her then and
likely still do now, all these years later. These latter girls
called her “Maggot” Margitan, as their mothers had no doubt
before them. And in The Village Vomit I had an item which
began, “Miss Margitan, known affectionately to Lisbonians
everywhere as Maggot . . .”
Mr. Higgins, our bald principal (breezily referred to in the
Vomit as Old Cue-Ball), told me that Miss Margitan had been
very hurt and very upset by what I had written. She was
apparently not too hurt to remember that old scriptural
admonition which goes “Vengeance is mine, saith the shorthand teacher,” however; Mr. Higgins said she wanted me
suspended from school.
In my character, a kind of wildness and a deep conservatism are wound together like hair in a braid. It was the
crazy part of me that had first written The Village Vomit and
then carried it to school; now that troublesome Mr. Hyde had
dubbed up and slunk out the back door. Dr. Jekyll was left to
consider how my mom would look at me if she found out I
had been suspended—her hurt eyes. I had to put thoughts of
her out of my mind, and fast. I was a sophomore, I was a year
older than most others in my class, and at six feet two I was
one of the bigger boys in school. I desperately didn’t want to
cry in Mr. Higgins’s office—not with kids surging through
53

Stephen King

the halls and looking curiously in the window at us: Mr.
Higgins behind his desk, me in the Bad Boy Seat.
In the end, Miss Margitan settled for a formal apology and
two weeks of detention for the bad boy who had dared call her
Maggot in print. It was bad, but what in high school is not?
At the time we’re stuck in it, like hostages locked in a Turkish bath, high school seems the most serious business in the
world to just about all of us. It’s not until the second or third
class reunion that we start realizing how absurd the whole
thing was.
A day or two later I was ushered into Mr. Higgins’s office
and made to stand in front of her. Miss Margitan sat ramrodstraight with her arthritic hands folded in her lap and her gray
eyes fixed unflinchingly on my face, and I realized that something about her was different from any other adult I had
ever met. I didn’t pinpoint that difference at once, but I
knew that there would be no charming this lady, no winning
her over. Later, while I was flying paper planes with the other
bad boys and bad girls in detention hall (detention turned out
to be not so bad), I decided that it was pretty simple: Miss
Margitan didn’t like boys. She was the first woman I ever met
in my life who didn’t like boys, not even one little bit.
If it makes any difference, my apology was heartfelt. Miss
Margitan really had been hurt by what I wrote, and that
much I could understand. I doubt that she hated me—she
was probably too busy—but she was the National Honor
Society advisor at LHS, and when my name showed up on the
candidate list two years later, she vetoed me. The Honor
Society did not need boys “of his type,” she said. I have come
to believe she was right. A boy who once wiped his ass with
poison ivy probably doesn’t belong in a smart people’s club.
I haven’t trucked much with satire since then.

Hardly a week after being sprung from detention hall, I was
once more invited to step down to the principal’s office. I
went with a sinking heart, wondering what new shit I’d
stepped in.
It wasn’t Mr. Higgins who wanted to see me, at least; this
time the school guidance counsellor had issued the summons. There had been discussions about me, he said, and
how to turn my “restless pen” into more constructive channels. He had enquired of John Gould, editor of Lisbon’s
weekly newspaper, and had discovered Gould had an opening for a sports reporter. While the school couldn’t insist that
I take this job, everyone in the front office felt it would be a
good idea. Do it or die, the G.C.’s eyes suggested. Maybe that
was just paranoia, but even now, almost forty years later, I
don’t think so.
I groaned inside. I was shut of Dave’s Rag, almost shut of The
Drum, and now here was the Lisbon Weekly Enterprise. Instead
of being haunted by waters, like Norman Maclean in A River
Runs Through It, I was as a teenager haunted by newspapers.
Still, what could I do? I rechecked the look in the guidance
counsellor’s eyes and said I would be delighted to interview for
the job.
Gould—not the well-known New England humorist or
the novelist who wrote The Greenleaf Fires but a relation of
both, I think—greeted me warily but with some interest. We
would try each other out, he said, if that suited me.
Now that I was away from the administrative offices of
Lisbon High, I felt able to muster a little honesty. I told Mr.
55

Stephen King

Gould that I didn’t know much about sports. Gould said,
“These are games people understand when they’re watching
them drunk in bars. You’ll learn if you try.”
He gave me a huge roll of yellow paper on which to type
my copy—I think I still have it somewhere—and promised
me a wage of half a cent a word. It was the first time someone
had promised me wages for writing.
The first two pieces I turned in had to do with a basketball
game in which an LHS player broke the school scoring
record. One was a straight piece of reporting. The other was
a sidebar about Robert Ransom’s record-breaking performance. I brought both to Gould the day after the game so
he’d have them for Friday, which was when the paper came
out. He read the game piece, made two minor corrections,
and spiked it. Then he started in on the feature piece with a
large black pen.
I took my fair share of English Lit classes in my two remaining years at Lisbon, and my fair share of composition, fiction,
and poetry classes in college, but John Gould taught me
more than any of them, and in no more than ten minutes. I
wish I still had the piece—it deserves to be framed, editorial
corrections and all—but I can remember pretty well how it
went and how it looked after Gould had combed through it
with that black pen of his. Here’s an example:
Last night, in the well-loved gymnasium of Lisbon
High School, partisans and Jay Hills fans alike were
stunned by an athletic performance unequalled in
school history. Bob Ransom, known as “Bullet” Bob
for both his size and accuracy, scored thirty-seven
points. Yes, you heard me right. Plus he did it with
grace, speed . . . and with an odd courtesy as well,

56

On Writing
committing only two personal fouls in his knight-like
quest for a record which has eluded Lisbon thinclads
since the years of Korea . . .

Gould stopped at “the years of Korea” and looked up at
me. “What year was the last record made?” he asked.
Luckily, I had my notes. “1953,” I said. Gould grunted and
went back to work. When he finished marking my copy in
the manner indicated above, he looked up and saw something
on my face. I think he must have mistaken it for horror. It
wasn’t; it was pure revelation. Why, I wondered, didn’t
English teachers ever do this? It was like the Visible Man Old
Raw Diehl had on his desk in the biology room.
“I only took out the bad parts, you know,” Gould said.
“Most of it’s pretty good.”
“I know,” I said, meaning both things: yes, most of it was
good—okay anyway, serviceable—and yes, he had only
taken out the bad parts. “I won’t do it again.”
He laughed. “If that’s true, you’ll never have to work for a
living. You can do this instead. Do I have to explain any of
these marks?”
“No,” I said.
“When you write a story, you’re telling yourself the story,”
he said. “When you rewrite, your main job is taking out all
the things that are not the story.”
Gould said something else that was interesting on the day
I turned in my first two pieces: write with the door closed,
rewrite with the door open. Your stuff starts out being just
for you, in other words, but then it goes out. Once you know
what the story is and get it right—as right as you can, anyway—it belongs to anyone who wants to read it. Or criticize
it. If you’re very lucky (this is my idea, not John Gould’s, but
57

Stephen King

I believe he would have subscribed to the notion), more will
want to do the former than the latter.

Just after the senior class trip to Washington, D.C., I got a job
at Worumbo Mills and Weaving, in Lisbon Falls. I didn’t
want it—the work was hard and boring, the mill itself a
dingy fuckhole overhanging the polluted Androscoggin River
like a workhouse in a Charles Dickens novel—but I needed
the paycheck. My mother was making lousy wages as a
housekeeper at a facility for the mentally ill in New Gloucester, but she was determined I was going to college like my
brother David (University of Maine, class of ’66, cum laude). In
her mind, the education had become almost secondary.
Durham and Lisbon Falls and the University of Maine at
Orono were part of a small world where folks neighbored and
still minded each other’s business on the four- and six-party
lines which then served the Sticksville townships. In the big
world, boys who didn’t go to college were being sent overseas
to fight in Mr. Johnson’s undeclared war, and many of them
were coming home in boxes. My mother liked Lyndon’s War
on Poverty (“That’s the war I’m in,” she sometimes said), but
not what he was up to in Southeast Asia. Once I told her that
enlisting and going over there might be good for me—surely
there would be a book in it, I said.
“Don’t be an idiot, Stephen,” she said. “With your eyes,
you’d be the first one to get shot. You can’t write if you’re
dead.”
She meant it; her head was set and so was her heart. Consequently, I applied for scholarships, I applied for loans, and I
58

On Writing

went to work in the mill. I certainly wouldn’t get far on the
five and six dollars a week I could make writing about bowling tournaments and Soap Box Derby races for the Enterprise.
During my final weeks at Lisbon High, my schedule
looked like this: up at seven, off to school at seven-thirty, last
bell at two o’clock, punch in on the third floor of Worumbo at
2:58, bag loose fabric for eight hours, punch out at 11:02, get
home around quarter of twelve, eat a bowl of cereal, fall into
bed, get up the next morning, do it all again. On a few occasions I worked double shifts, slept in my ’60 Ford Galaxie
(Dave’s old car) for an hour or so before school, then slept
through periods five and six in the nurse’s cubicle after lunch.
Once summer vacation came, things got easier. I was
moved down to the dyehouse in the basement, for one thing,
where it was thirty degrees cooler. My job was dyeing
swatches of melton cloth purple or navy blue. I imagine there
are still folks in New England with jackets in their closets
dyed by yours truly. It wasn’t the best summer I ever spent,
but I managed to avoid being sucked into the machinery or
stitching my fingers together with one of the heavy-duty
sewing machines we used to belt the undyed cloth.
During Fourth of July week, the mill closed. Employees
with five years or more at Worumbo got the week off with pay.
Those with fewer than five years were offered work on a crew
that was going to clean the mill from top to bottom, including the basement, which hadn’t been touched in forty or fifty
years. I probably would have agreed to work on this crew—it
was time and a half—but all the positions were filled long
before the foreman got down to the high school kids, who’d be
gone in September. When I got back to work the following
week, one of the dyehouse guys told me I should have been
there, it was wild. “The rats down in that basement were big
59

Stephen King

as cats,” he said. “Some of them, goddam if they weren’t as big
as dogs.”
Rats as big as dogs! Yow!
One day late in my final semester at college, finals over
and at loose ends, I recalled the dyehouse guy’s story about
the rats under the mill—big as cats, goddam, some as big as
dogs—and started writing a story called “Graveyard Shift.” I
was only passing the time on a late spring afternoon, but two
months later Cavalier magazine bought the story for two
hundred dollars. I had sold two other stories previous to this,
but they had brought in a total of just sixty-five dollars. This
was three times that, and at a single stroke. It took my
breath away, it did. I was rich.

During the summer of 1969 I got a work-study job in the
University of Maine library. That was a season both fair and
foul. In Vietnam, Nixon was executing his plan to end the
war, which seemed to consist of bombing most of Southeast
Asia into Kibbles ’n Bits. “Meet the new boss,” The Who
sang, “same as the old boss.” Eugene McCarthy was concentrating on his poetry, and happy hippies wore bell-bottom
pants and tee-shirts that said things like KILLING FOR PEACE IS
LIKE FUCKING FOR CHASTITY. I had a great set of muttonchop sideburns. Creedence Clearwater Revival was singing “Green
River”—barefoot girls, dancing in the moonlight—and
Kenny Rogers was still with The First Edition. Martin Luther
King and Robert Kennedy were dead, but Janis Joplin, Jim
Morrison, Bob “The Bear” Hite, Jimi Hendrix, Cass Elliot,
John Lennon, and Elvis Presley were still alive and making
60

On Writing

music. I was staying just off campus in Ed Price’s Rooms
(seven bucks a week, one change of sheets included). Men had
landed on the moon, and I had landed on the Dean’s List.
Miracles and wonders abounded.
One day in late June of that summer, a bunch of us library
guys had lunch on the grass behind the university bookstore.
Sitting between Paolo Silva and Eddie Marsh was a trim girl
with a raucous laugh, red-tinted hair, and the prettiest legs I
had ever seen, well-displayed beneath a short yellow skirt. She
was carrying a copy of Soul on Ice, by Eldridge Cleaver. I
hadn’t run across her in the library, and I didn’t believe a college student could utter such a wonderful, unafraid laugh.
Also, heavy reading or no heavy reading, she swore like a millworker instead of a coed. (Having been a millworker, I was
qualified to judge.) Her name was Tabitha Spruce. We got
married a year and a half later. We’re still married, and she has
never let me forget that the first time I met her I thought she
was Eddie Marsh’s townie girlfriend. Maybe a book-reading
waitress from the local pizza joint on her afternoon off.

– 23 –
It’s worked. Our marriage has outlasted all of the world’s
leaders except for Castro, and if we keep talking, arguing,
making love, and dancing to the Ramones—gabba-gabbahey—it’ll probably keep working. We came from different
religions, but as a feminist Tabby has never been crazy about
the Catholics, where the men make the rules (including the
God-given directive to always go in bareback) and the women
wash the underwear. And while I believe in God I have no use
for organized religion. We came from similar working-class
61

Stephen King

backgrounds, we both ate meat, we were both political
Democrats with typical Yankee suspicions of life outside New
England. We were sexually compatible and monogamous by
nature. Yet what ties us most strongly are the words, the language, and the work of our lives.
We met when we were working in a library, and I fell in
love with her during a poetry workshop in the fall of 1969,
when I was a senior and Tabby was a junior. I fell in love with
her partly because I understood what she was doing with her
work. I fell because she understood what she was doing with
it. I also fell because she was wearing a sexy black dress and
silk stockings, the kind that hook with garters.
I don’t want to speak too disparagingly of my generation
(actually I do, we had a chance to change the world and
opted for the Home Shopping Network instead), but there
was a view among the student writers I knew at that time
that good writing came spontaneously, in an uprush of feeling that had to be caught at once; when you were building
that all-important stairway to heaven, you couldn’t just
stand around with your hammer in your hand. Ars poetica in
1969 was perhaps best expressed by a Donovan Leitch song
that went, “First there is a mountain / Then there is no
mountain / Then there is.” Would-be poets were living in a
dewy Tolkien-tinged world, catching poems out of the ether.
It was pretty much unanimous: serious art came from . . . out
there! Writers were blessed stenographers taking divine dictation. I don’t want to embarrass any of my old mates from
that period, so here is a fictionalized version of what I’m talking about, created from bits of many actual poems:
i close my eyes
in th dark i see
62

On Writing

Rodan
Rimbaud
in th dark
i swallow th cloth
of loneliness
crow i am here
raven i am here
If you were to ask the poet what this poem meant, you’d
likely get a look of contempt. A slightly uncomfortable
silence was apt to emanate from the rest. Certainly the fact
that the poet would likely have been unable to tell you anything about the mechanics of creation would not have been
considered important. If pressed, he or she might have said
that there were no mechanics, only that seminal spurt of feeling: first there is a mountain, then there is no mountain, then
there is. And if the resulting poem is sloppy, based on the
assumption that such general words as “loneliness” mean the
same thing to all of us—hey man, so what, let go of that outdated bullshit and just dig the heaviness. I didn’t cop to
much of this attitude (although I didn’t dare say so out loud,
at least not in so many words), and was overjoyed to find that
the pretty girl in the black dress and the silk stockings didn’t
cop to much of it, either. She didn’t come right out and say
so, but she didn’t need to. Her work spoke for her.
The workshop group met once or twice a week in the living room of instructor Jim Bishop’s house, perhaps a dozen
undergrads and three or four faculty members working in a
marvellous atmosphere of equality. Poems were typed up and
mimeographed in the English Department office on the day
of each workshop. Poets read while the rest of us followed
along on our copies. Here is one of Tabby’s poems from that
fall:
63

Stephen King
A G RADUAL C ANTICLE FOR AUGUSTINE

The thinnest bear is awakened in the winter
by the sleep-laughter of locusts,
by the dream-blustering of bees,
by the honeyed scent of desert sands
that the wind carries in her womb
into the distant hills, into the houses of Cedar.
The bear has heard a sure promise.
Certain words are edible; they nourish
more than snow heaped upon silver plates
or ice overflowing golden bowls. Chips of ice
from the mouth of a lover are not always better,
Nor a desert dreaming always a mirage.
The rising bear sings a gradual canticle
woven of sand that conquers cities
by a slow cycle. His praise seduces
a passing wind, traveling to the sea
wherein a fish, caught in a careful net,
hears a bear’s song in the cool-scented snow.
There was silence when Tabby finished reading. No one
knew exactly how to react. Cables seemed to run through the
poem, tightening the lines until they almost hummed. I
found the combination of crafty diction and delirious
imagery exciting and illuminating. Her poem also made me
feel that I wasn’t alone in my belief that good writing can be
simultaneously intoxicating and idea-driven. If stone-sober
people can fuck like they’re out of their minds—can actually
be out of their minds while caught in that throe—why
shouldn’t writers be able to go bonkers and still stay sane?
64

On Writing

There was also a work-ethic in the poem that I liked,
something that suggested writing poems (or stories, or essays)
had as much in common with sweeping the floor as with
mythy moments of revelation. There’s a place in A Raisin in
the Sun where a character cries out: “I want to fly! I want to
touch the sun!” to which his wife replies, “First eat your
eggs.”
In the discussion that followed Tab’s reading, it became
clear to me that she understood her own poem. She knew
exactly what she had meant to say, and had said most of it.
Saint Augustine (A.D. 354–430) she knew both as a Catholic
and as a history major. Augustine’s mother (a saint herself)
was a Christian, his father a pagan. Before his conversion,
Augustine pursued both money and women. Following it he
continued to struggle with his sexual impulses, and is known
for the Libertine’s Prayer, which goes: “O Lord, make me
chaste . . . but not yet.” In his writing he focused on man’s
struggle to give up belief in self in favor of belief in God. And
he sometimes likened himself to a bear. Tabby has a way of
tilting her chin down when she smiles—it makes her look
both wise and severely cute. She did that then, I remember,
and said, “Besides, I like bears.”
The canticle is gradual perhaps because the bear’s awakening is gradual. The bear is powerful and sensual, although
thin because he is out of his time. In a way, Tabby said when
called upon to explicate, the bear can be seen as a symbol of
mankind’s troubling and wonderful habit of dreaming the
right dreams at the wrong time. Such dreams are difficult
because they’re inappropriate, but also wonderful in their
promise. The poem also suggests that dreams are powerful—the bear’s is strong enough to seduce the wind into
bringing his song to a fish caught in a net.
65

Stephen King

I won’t try to argue that “A Gradual Canticle” is a great
poem (although I think it’s a pretty good one). The point is
that it was a reasonable poem in a hysterical time, one sprung
from a writing ethic that resonated all through my heart and
soul.
Tabby was in one of Jim Bishop’s rocking chairs that night.
I was sitting on the floor beside her. I put my hand on her calf
as she spoke, cupping the curve of warm flesh through her
stocking. She smiled at me. I smiled back. Sometimes these
things are not accidents. I’m almost sure of it.

– 24 –
We had two kids by the time we’d been married three years.
They were neither planned nor unplanned; they came when
they came, and we were glad to have them. Naomi was prone
to ear infections. Joe was healthy enough but never seemed to
sleep. When Tabby went into labor with him, I was at a
drive-in movie in Brewer with a friend—it was a Memorial
Day triple feature, three horror films. We were on the third
movie (The Corpse Grinders) and the second sixpack when the
guy in the office broke in with an announcement. There were
still pole-speakers in those days; when you parked your car
you lifted one off and hung it over your window. The manager’s announcement thus rang across the entire parking lot:
“STEVE KING, PLEASE GO HOME! YOUR WIFE IS IN LABOR! STEVE KING,
PLEASE GO HOME! YOUR WIFE IS GOING TO HAVE THE BABY!”
As I drove our old Plymouth toward the exit, a couple of
hundred horns blared a satiric salute. Many people flicked
their headlights on and off, bathing me in a stuttery glow. My
friend Jimmy Smith laughed so hard he slid into the footwell
66

on the passenger side of the front seat. There he remained for
most of the trip back to Bangor, chortling among the beercans. When I got home, Tabby was calm and packed. She
gave birth to Joe less than three hours later. He entered the
world easily. For the next five years or so, nothing else about
Joe was easy. But he was a treat. Both of them were, really.
Even when Naomi was tearing off the wallpaper above her
crib (maybe she thought she was housekeeping) and Joe was
shitting in the wicker seat of the rocker we kept on the porch
of our apartment on Sanford Street, they were a treat.

My mother knew I wanted to be a writer (with all those
rejection slips hanging from the spike on my bedroom wall,
how could she not?), but she encouraged me to get a teacher’s
credential “so you’ll have something to fall back on.”
“You may want to get married, Stephen, and a garret by
the Seine is only romantic if you’re a bachelor,” she’d said
once. “It’s no place to raise a family.”
I did as she suggested, entering the College of Education
at UMO and emerging four years later with a teacher’s certificate . . . sort of like a golden retriever emerging from a
pond with a dead duck in its jaws. It was dead, all right. I
couldn’t find a teaching job and so went to work at New
Franklin Laundry for wages not much higher than those I
had been making at Worumbo Mills and Weaving four years
before. I was keeping my family in a series of garrets which
overlooked not the Seine but some of Bangor’s less appetizing streets, the ones where the police cruisers always seemed
to show up at two o’clock on Saturday morning.

I never saw personal laundry at New Franklin unless it was
a “fire order” being paid for by an insurance company (most
fire orders consisted of clothes that looked okay but smelled
like barbecued monkeymeat). The greater part of what I
loaded and pulled were motel sheets from Maine’s coastal
towns and table linen from Maine’s coastal restaurants. The
table linen was desperately nasty. When tourists go out to
dinner in Maine, they usually want clams and lobster. Mostly
lobster. By the time the tablecloths upon which these delicacies had been served reached me, they stank to high heaven
and were often boiling with maggots. The maggots would try
to crawl up your arms as you loaded the washers; it was as if
the little fuckers knew you were planning to cook them. I
thought I’d get used to them in time but I never did. The
maggots were bad; the smell of decomposing clams and lobster-meat was even worse. Why are people such slobs? I would
wonder, loading feverish linens from Testa’s of Bar Harbor
into my machines. Why are people such fucking slobs?
Hospital sheets and linens were even worse. These also
crawled with maggots in the summertime, but it was blood
they were feeding on instead of lobster-meat and clam-jelly.
Clothes, sheets, and pillowslips deemed to be infected were
stuffed inside what we called “plague-bags” which dissolved
when the hot water hit them, but blood was not, in those
times, considered to be especially dangerous. There were often
little extras in the hospital laundry; those loads were like nasty
boxes of Cracker Jacks with weird prizes in them. I found a
steel bedpan in one load and a pair of surgical shears in
another (the bedpan was of no practical use, but the shears
were a damned handy kitchen implement). Ernest “Rocky”
Rockwell, the guy I worked with, found twenty dollars in a
load from Eastern Maine Medical Center and punched out at
68

On Writing

noon to start drinking. (Rocky referred to quitting time as
“Slitz o’clock.”)
On one occasion I heard a strange clicking from inside
one of the Washex three-pockets which were my responsibility. I hit the Emergency Stop button, thinking the goddam
thing was stripping its gears or something. I opened the
doors and hauled out a huge wad of dripping surgical tunics
and green caps, soaking myself in the process. Below them,
lying scattered across the colander-like inner sleeve of the
middle pocket, was what looked like a complete set of human
teeth. It crossed my mind that they would make an interesting necklace, then I scooped them out and tossed them in the
trash. My wife has put up with a lot from me over the years,
but her sense of humor stretches only so far.

– 26 –
From a financial point of view, two kids were probably two
too many for college grads working in a laundry and the second shift at Dunkin’ Donuts. The only edge we had came
courtesy of magazines like Dude, Cavalier, Adam,and Swank—
what my Uncle Oren used to call “the titty books.” By 1972
they were showing quite a lot more than bare breasts and fiction was on its way out, but I was lucky enough to ride the
last wave. I wrote after work; when we lived on Grove Street,
which was close to the New Franklin, I would sometimes
write a little on my lunch hour, too. I suppose that sounds
almost impossibly Abe Lincoln, but it was no big deal—I was
having fun. Those stories, grim as some of them were, served
as brief escapes from the boss, Mr. Brooks, and Harry the
floor-man.
69

Stephen King

Harry had hooks instead of hands as a result of a tumble
into the sheet-mangler during World War II (he was dusting
the beams above the machine and fell off). A comedian at
heart, he would sometimes duck into the bathroom and run
water from the cold tap over one hook and water from the hot
tap over the other. Then he’d sneak up behind you while
you were loading laundry and lay the steel hooks on the back
of your neck. Rocky and I spent a fair amount of time speculating on how Harry accomplished certain bathroom cleanup
activities. “Well,” Rocky said one day while we were drinking
our lunch in his car, “at least he don’t need to wash his
hands.”
There were times—especially in summer, while swallowing my afternoon salt-pill—when it occurred to me that I
was simply repeating my mother’s life. Usually this thought
struck me as funny. But if I happened to be tired, or if there
were extra bills to pay and no money to pay them with, it
seemed awful. I’d think This isn’t the way our lives are supposed
to be going. Then I’d think Half the world has the same idea.
The stories I sold to the men’s magazines between August
of 1970, when I got my two-hundred-dollar check for “Graveyard Shift,” and the winter of 1973–1974 were just enough to
create a rough sliding margin between us and the welfare office
(my mother, a Republican all her life, had communicated her
deep horror of “going on the county” to me; Tabby had some
of that same horror).
My clearest memory of those days is of our coming back to
the Grove Street apartment one Sunday afternoon after
spending the weekend at my mother’s house in Durham—
this would have been right around the time the symptoms of
the cancer which killed her started to show themselves. I
have a picture from that day—Mom, looking both tired and
70

On Writing

amused, is sitting in a chair in her dooryard, holding Joe in
her lap while Naomi stands sturdily beside her. Naomi wasn’t
so sturdy by Sunday afternoon, however; she had come down
with an ear infection, and was burning with fever.
Trudging from the car to our apartment building on that
summer afternoon was a low point. I was carrying Naomi and
a tote-bag full of baby survival equipment (bottles, lotions,
diapers, sleep suits, undershirts, socks) while Tabby carried
Joe, who had spit up on her. She was dragging a sack of
dirty diapers behind her. We both knew Naomi needed THE
PINK STUFF, which was what we called liquid amoxicillin.
THE PINK STUFF was expensive, and we were broke. I
mean stony.
I managed to get the downstairs door open without dropping my daughter and was easing her inside (she was so feverish she glowed against my chest like a banked coal) when I
saw there was an envelope sticking out of our mailbox—a
rare Saturday delivery. Young marrieds don’t get much mail;
everyone but the gas and electric companies seems to forget
they are alive. I snagged it, praying it wouldn’t turn out to be
another bill. It wasn’t. My friends at the Dugent Publishing
Corporation, purveyors of Cavalier and many other fine adult
publications, had sent me a check for “Sometimes They Come
Back,” a long story I hadn’t believed would sell anywhere.
The check was for five hundred dollars, easily the largest sum
I’d ever received. Suddenly we were able to afford not only a
doctor’s visit and a bottle of THE PINK STUFF, but also a
nice Sunday-night meal. And I imagine that once the kids
were asleep, Tabby and I got friendly.
I think we had a lot of happiness in those days, but we
were scared a lot, too. We weren’t much more than kids ourselves (as the saying goes), and being friendly helped keep
71

Stephen King

the mean reds away. We took care of ourselves and the kids
and each other as best we could. Tabby wore her pink uniform out to Dunkin’ Donuts and called the cops when the
drunks who came in for coffee got obstreperous. I washed
motel sheets and kept writing one-reel horror movies.

– 27 –
By the time I started Carrie, I had landed a job teaching
English in the nearby town of Hampden. I would be paid
sixty-four hundred dollars a year, which seemed an unthinkable sum after earning a dollar-sixty an hour at the laundry. If
I’d done the math, being careful to add in all the time spent in
after-school conferences and correcting papers at home, I
might have seen it was a very thinkable sum indeed, and that
our situation was worse than ever. By the late winter of 1973
we were living in a doublewide trailer in Hermon, a little town
west of Bangor. (Much later, when asked to do the Playboy
Interview, I called Hermon “The asshole of the world.” Hermonites were infuriated by that, and I hereby apologize. Hermon is really no more than the armpit of the world.) I was
driving a Buick with transmission problems we couldn’t
afford to fix, Tabby was still working at Dunkin’ Donuts, and
we had no telephone. We simply couldn’t afford the monthly
charge. Tabby tried her hand at confession stories during that
period (“Too Pretty to Be a Virgin”—stuff like that), and got
personal responses of the this-isn’t-quite-right-for-us-buttry-again type immediately. She would have broken through
if given an extra hour or two in every day, but she was stuck
with the usual twenty-four. Besides, any amusement value the
confession-mag formula (it’s called the Three R’s—Rebel72

On Writing

lion, Ruin, and Redemption) might have had for her at the
start wore off in a hurry.
I wasn’t having much success with my own writing, either.
Horror, science fiction, and crime stories in the men’s magazines were being replaced by increasingly graphic tales of
sex. That was part of the trouble, but not all of it. The bigger
deal was that, for the first time in my life, writing was hard.
The problem was the teaching. I liked my coworkers and
loved the kids—even the Beavis and Butt-Head types in Living with English could be interesting—but by most Friday
afternoons I felt as if I’d spent the week with jumper cables
clamped to my brain. If I ever came close to despairing about
my future as a writer, it was then. I could see myself thirty
years on, wearing the same shabby tweed coats with patches
on the elbows, potbelly rolling over my Gap khakis from
too much beer. I’d have a cigarette cough from too many
packs of Pall Malls, thicker glasses, more dandruff, and in my
desk drawer, six or seven unfinished manuscripts which I
would take out and tinker with from time to time, usually
when drunk. If asked what I did in my spare time, I’d
tell people I was writing a book—what else does any selfrespecting creative-writing teacher do with his or her spare
time? And of course I’d lie to myself, telling myself there was
still time, it wasn’t too late, there were novelists who didn’t
get started until they were fifty, hell, even sixty. Probably
plenty of them.
My wife made a crucial difference during those two years I
spent teaching at Hampden (and washing sheets at New
Franklin Laundry during the summer vacation). If she had
suggested that the time I spent writing stories on the front
porch of our rented house on Pond Street or in the laundry
room of our rented trailer on Klatt Road in Hermon was
73

Stephen King

wasted time, I think a lot of the heart would have gone out of
me. Tabby never voiced a single doubt, however. Her support
was a constant, one of the few good things I could take as a
given. And whenever I see a first novel dedicated to a wife (or
a husband), I smile and think, There’s someone who knows. Writing is a lonely job. Having someone who believes in you
makes a lot of difference. They don’t have to make speeches.
Just believing is usually enough.

– 28 –
While he was going to college my brother Dave worked
summers as a janitor at Brunswick High, his old alma mater.
For part of one summer I worked there, too. I can’t remember which year, only that it was before I met Tabby but after
I started to smoke. That would have made me nineteen or
twenty, I suppose. I got paired with a guy named Harry, who
wore green fatigues, a big keychain, and walked with a limp.
(He did have hands instead of hooks, however.) One lunch
hour Harry told me what it had been like to face a Japanese
banzai charge on the island of Tarawa, all the Japanese officers waving swords made out of Maxwell House coffee cans,
all the screaming enlisted men behind them stoned out of
their gourds and smelling of burned poppies. Quite a raconteur was my pal Harry.
One day he and I were supposed to scrub the rust-stains off
the walls in the girls’ shower. I looked around the locker
room with the interest of a Muslim youth who for some reason finds himself deep within the women’s quarters. It was
the same as the boys’ locker room, and yet completely different. There were no urinals, of course, and there were two extra
74

On Writing

metal boxes on the tile walls—unmarked, and the wrong
size for paper towels. I asked what was in them. “Pussyplugs,” Harry said. “For them certain days of the month.”
I also noticed that the showers, unlike those in the boys’
locker room, had chrome U-rings with pink plastic curtains
attached. You could actually shower in privacy. I mentioned
this to Harry, and he shrugged. “I guess young girls are a bit
more shy about being undressed.”
This memory came back to me one day while I was working at the laundry, and I started seeing the opening scene of a
story: girls showering in a locker room where there were no
U-rings, pink plastic curtains, or privacy. And this one girl
starts to have her period. Only she doesn’t know what it is,
and the other girls—grossed out, horrified, amused—start
pelting her with sanitary napkins. Or with tampons, which
Harry had called pussy-plugs. The girl begins to scream. All
that blood! She thinks she’s dying, that the other girls are
making fun of her even while she’s bleeding to death . . . she
reacts . . . fights back . . . but how?
I’d read an article in Life magazine some years before, suggesting that at least some reported poltergeist activity might
actually be telekinetic phenomena—telekinesis being the ability to move objects just by thinking about them. There was
some evidence to suggest that young people might have such
powers, the article said, especially girls in early adolescence,
right around the time of their first—
Pow! Two unrelated ideas, adolescent cruelty and telekinesis, came together, and I had an idea. I didn’t leave my post at
Washex #2, didn’t go running around the laundry waving
my arms and shouting “Eureka!,” however. I’d had many
other ideas as good and some that were better. Still, I thought
I might have the basis for a good Cavalier yarn, with the
75

Stephen King

possibility of Playboy lurking in the back of my mind. Playboy
paid up to two thousand dollars for short fiction. Two thousand bucks would buy a new transmission for the Buick with
plenty left over for groceries. The story remained on the back
burner for awhile, simmering away in that place that’s not
quite the conscious but not quite the subconscious, either. I
had started my teaching career before I sat down one night to
give it a shot. I did three single-spaced pages of a first draft,
then crumpled them up in disgust and threw them away.
I had four problems with what I’d written. First and least
important was the fact that the story didn’t move me emotionally. Second and slightly more important was the fact
that I didn’t much like the lead character. Carrie White
seemed thick and passive, a ready-made victim. The other
girls were chucking tampons and sanitary napkins at her,
chanting “Plug it up! Plug it up!” and I just didn’t care.
Third and more important still was not feeling at home with
either the surroundings or my all-girl cast of supporting characters. I had landed on Planet Female, and one sortie into the
girls’ locker room at Brunswick High School years before
wasn’t much help in navigating there. For me writing has
always been best when it’s intimate, as sexy as skin on skin.
With Carrie I felt as if I were wearing a rubber wet-suit I
couldn’t pull off. Fourth and most important of all was the
realization that the story wouldn’t pay off unless it was pretty
long, probably even longer than “Sometimes They Come
Back,” which had been at the absolute outer limit of what the
men’s magazine market could accept in terms of word-count.
You had to save plenty of room for those pictures of cheerleaders who had somehow forgotten to put on their underpants—they were what guys really bought the magazines for.
I couldn’t see wasting two weeks, maybe even a month, cre76

On Writing

ating a novella I didn’t like and wouldn’t be able to sell. So I
threw it away.
The next night, when I came home from school, Tabby
had the pages. She’d spied them while emptying my wastebasket, had shaken the cigarette ashes off the crumpled balls
of paper, smoothed them out, and sat down to read them.
She wanted me to go on with it, she said. She wanted to
know the rest of the story. I told her I didn’t know jackshit about high school girls. She said she’d help me with that
part. She had her chin tilted down and was smiling in that
severely cute way of hers. “You’ve got something here,” she
said. “I really think you do.”

– 29 –
I never got to like Carrie White and I never trusted Sue
Snell’s motives in sending her boyfriend to the prom with her,
but I did have something there. Like a whole career. Tabby
somehow knew it, and by the time I had piled up fifty singlespaced pages, I knew it, too. For one thing, I didn’t think any
of the characters who went to Carrie White’s prom would
ever forget it. Those few who lived through it, that was.
I had written three other novels before Carrie—Rage, The
Long Walk, and The Running Man were later published. Rage is
the most troubling of them. The Long Walk may be the best of
them. But none of them taught me the things I learned from
Carrie White. The most important is that the writer’s original
perception of a character or characters may be as erroneous as
the reader’s. Running a close second was the realization that
stopping a piece of work just because it’s hard, either emotionally or imaginatively, is a bad idea. Sometimes you have to
77

Stephen King

go on when you don’t feel like it, and sometimes you’re doing
good work when it feels like all you’re managing is to shovel
shit from a sitting position.
Tabby helped me, beginning with the information that
the sanitary-napkin dispensers in high schools were usually
not coin-op—faculty and administration didn’t like the idea
of girls’ walking around with blood all over their skirts just
because they happened to come to school short a quarter, my
wife said. And I also helped myself, digging back to my
memories of high school (my job teaching English didn’t
help; I was twenty-six by then, and on the wrong side of the
desk), remembering what I knew about the two loneliest,
most reviled girls in my class—how they looked, how they
acted, how they were treated. Very rarely in my career have I
explored more distasteful territory.
I’ll call one of these girls Sondra. She and her mother lived
in a trailer home not too far from me, with their dog, Cheddar Cheese. Sondra had a burbly, uneven voice, as if she were
always speaking through a throatful of tightly packed
phlegm. She wasn’t fat, but her flesh had a loose, pale look,
like the undersides of some mushrooms. Her hair clung to her
pimply cheeks in tight Little Orphan Annie curls. She had no
friends (except for Cheddar Cheese, I guess). One day her
mother hired me to move some furniture. Dominating the
trailer’s living room was a nearly life-sized crucified Jesus, eyes
turned up, mouth turned down, blood dribbling from
beneath the crown of thorns on his head. He was naked
except for a rag twisted around his hips and loins. Above this
bit of breechclout were the hollowed belly and the jutting ribs
of a concentration-camp inmate. It occurred to me that Sondra had grown up beneath the agonal gaze of this dying god,
and doing so had undoubtedly played a part in making her
78

On Writing

what she was when I knew her: a timid and homely outcast
who went scuttling through the halls of Lisbon High like a
frightened mouse.
“That’s Jesus Christ, my Lord and Savior,” Sondra’s mother
said, following my gaze. “Have you been saved, Steve?”
I hastened to tell her I was saved as saved could be, although
I didn’t think you could ever be good enough to have that version of Jesus intervene on your behalf. The pain had driven him
out of his mind. You could see it on his face. If that guy came
back, he probably wouldn’t be in a saving mood.
The other girl I’ll call Dodie Franklin, only the other girls
called her Dodo or Doodoo. Her parents were interested in
only one thing, and that was entering contests. They were
good at them, too; they had won all sorts of odd stuff, including a year’s supply of Three Diamonds Brand Fancy Tuna and
Jack Benny’s Maxwell automobile. The Maxwell sat off to the
left of their house in that part of Durham known as Southwest
Bend, gradually sinking into the landscape. Every year or two,
one of the local papers—the Portland Press-Herald, the Lewiston Sun, the Lisbon Weekly Enterprise—would do a piece on all
the weird shit Dodie’s folks had won in raffles and sweepstakes and giant prize drawings. Usually there would be a
photo of the Maxwell, or Jack Benny with his violin, or both.
Whatever the Franklins might have won, a supply of
clothes for growing teenagers wasn’t part of the haul. Dodie
and her brother Bill wore the same stuff every day for the
first year and a half of high school: black pants and a shortsleeved checked sport shirt for him, a long black skirt, gray
knee-socks, and a sleeveless white blouse for her. Some of
my readers may not believe I am being literal when I say every
day, but those who grew up in country towns during the
fifties and sixties will know that I am. In the Durham of my
79

Stephen King

childhood, life wore little or any makeup. I went to school
with kids who wore the same neckdirt for months, kids
whose skin festered with sores and rashes, kids with the eerie
dried-apple-doll faces that result from untreated burns, kids
who were sent to school with stones in their dinnerbuckets
and nothing but air in their Thermoses. It wasn’t Arcadia;
for the most part it was Dogpatch with no sense of humor.
Dodie and Bill Franklin got on all right at Durham Elementary, but high school meant a much bigger town, and for
children like Dodie and Bill, Lisbon Falls meant ridicule and
ruin. We watched in amusement and horror as Bill’s sport
shirt faded and began to unravel from the short sleeves up. He
replaced a missing button with a paperclip. Tape, carefully
colored black with a crayon to match his pants, appeared over
a rip behind one knee. Dodie’s sleeveless white blouse began
to grow yellow with wear, age, and accumulated sweat-stains.
As it grew thinner, the straps of her bra showed through
more and more clearly. The other girls made fun of her, at first
behind her back and then to her face. Teasing became taunting. The boys weren’t a part of it; we had Bill to take care of
(yes, I helped—not a whole lot, but I was there). Dodie had it
worse, I think. The girls didn’t just laugh at Dodie; they
hated her, too. Dodie was everything they were afraid of.
After Christmas vacation of our sophomore year, Dodie
came back to school resplendent. The dowdy old black skirt
had been replaced by a cranberry-colored one that stopped at
her knees instead of halfway down her shins. The tatty kneesocks had been replaced by nylon stockings, which looked
pretty good because she had finally shaved the luxuriant mat
of black hair off her legs. The ancient sleeveless blouse had
given way to a soft wool sweater. She’d even had a permanent.
Dodie was a girl transformed, and you could see by her face
80

On Writing

that she knew it. I have no idea if she saved for those new
clothes, if they were given to her for Christmas by her parents,
or if she went through a hell of begging that finally bore dividends. It doesn’t matter, because mere clothes changed nothing. The teasing that day was worse than ever. Her peers had
no intention of letting her out of the box they’d put her in;
she was punished for even trying to break free. I had several
classes with her, and was able to observe Dodie’s ruination at
first hand. I saw her smile fade, saw the light in her eyes first
dim and then go out. By the end of the day she was the girl
she’d been before Christmas vacation—a dough-faced and
freckle-cheeked wraith, scurrying through the halls with her
eyes down and her books clasped to her chest.
She wore the new skirt and sweater the next day. And the
next. And the next. When the school year ended she was still
wearing them, although by then the weather was much too
hot for wool and there were always beads of sweat at her temples and on her upper lip. The home permanent wasn’t
repeated and the new clothes took on a matted, dispirited look,
but the teasing had dropped back to its pre-Christmas levels
and the taunting stopped entirely. Someone made a break for
the fence and had to be knocked down, that was all. Once the
escape was foiled and the entire company of prisoners was once
more accounted for, life could go back to normal.
Both Sondra and Dodie were dead by the time I started
writing Carrie. Sondra moved out of the trailer in Durham,
out from beneath the agonal gaze of the dying savior, and into
an apartment in Lisbon Falls. She must have worked somewhere close by, probably in one of the mills or shoe factories.
She was epileptic and died during a seizure. She lived alone, so
there was no one to help her when she went down with her
head bent the wrong way. Dodie married a TV weatherman
81

Stephen King

who gained something of a reputation in New England for his
drawling downeast delivery. Following the birth of a child—
I think it was their second—Dodie went into the cellar and
put a .22 bullet in her abdomen. It was a lucky shot (or
unlucky, depending on your point of view, I guess), hitting the
portal vein and killing her. In town they said it was postpartum depression, how sad. Myself, I suspected high school
hangover might have had something to do with it.
I never liked Carrie, that female version of Eric Harris and
Dylan Klebold, but through Sondra and Dodie I came at last
to understand her a little. I pitied her and I pitied her classmates as well, because I had been one of them once upon a
time.

– 30 –
The manuscript of Carrie went off to Doubleday, where I had
made a friend named William Thompson. I pretty much forgot about it and moved on with my life, which at that time
consisted of teaching school, raising kids, loving my wife,
getting drunk on Friday afternoons, and writing stories.
My free period that semester was five, right after lunch. I
usually spent it in the teachers’ room, grading papers and
wishing I could stretch out on the couch and take a nap—in
the early afternoon I have all the energy of a boa constrictor
that’s just swallowed a goat. The intercom came on and
Colleen Sites in the office asked if I was there. I said I was, and
she asked me to come to the office. I had a phone call. My
wife.
The walk from the teachers’ room in the lower wing to the
main office seemed long even with classes in session and the
82

On Writing

halls mostly empty. I hurried, not quite running, my heart
beating hard. Tabby would have had to dress the kids in their
boots and jackets to use the neighbors’ phone, and I could
think of only two reasons she might have done so. Either Joe
or Naomi had fallen off the stoop and broken a leg, or I had
sold Carrie.
My wife, sounding out of breath but deliriously happy,
read me a telegram. Bill Thompson (who would later go on to
discover a Mississippi scribbler named John Grisham) had sent
it after trying to call and discovering the Kings no longer had
a phone. CONGRATULATIONS, it read. CARRIE OFFICIALLY A DOUBLEDAY
BOOK. IS $2500 ADVANCE OKAY? THE FUTURE LIES AHEAD. LOVE, BILL.
Twenty-five hundred dollars was a very small advance,
even for the early seventies, but I didn’t know that and had no
literary agent to know it for me. Before it occurred to me that
I might actually need an agent, I had generated well over
three million dollars’ worth of income, a good deal of it for the
publisher. (The standard Doubleday contract in those days
was better than indentured servitude, but not much.) And my
little high school horror novel marched toward publication
with excruciating slowness. Although it was accepted in late
March or early April of 1973, publication wasn’t slated until
the spring of 1974. This wasn’t unusual. In those days Doubleday was an enormous fiction-mill churning out mysteries,
romances, science fiction yarns, and Double D westerns at a
rate of fifty or more a month, all of this in addition to a
robust frontlist including books by heavy hitters like Leon
Uris and Allen Drury. I was only one small fish in a very busy
river.
Tabby asked if I could quit teaching. I told her no, not
based on a twenty-five-hundred-dollar advance and only
nebulous possibilities beyond that. If I’d been on my own,
83

Stephen King

maybe (hell, probably). But with a wife and two kids? Not
happening. I remember the two of us lying in bed that night,
eating toast and talking until the small hours of the morning. Tabby asked me how much we’d make if Doubleday was
able to sell paperback reprint rights to Carrie, and I said I
didn’t know. I’d read that Mario Puzo had just scored a huge
advance for paperback rights to The Godfather—four hundred thousand dollars according to the newspaper—but I
didn’t believe Carrie would fetch anything near that, assuming it sold to paperback at all.
Tabby asked—rather timidly for my normally outspoken
wife—if I thought the book would find a paperback publisher. I told her I thought the chances were pretty good,
maybe seven or eight in ten. She asked how much it might
bring. I said my best guess would be somewhere between ten
and sixty thousand dollars.
“Sixty thousand dollars?” She sounded almost shocked. “Is
that much even possible?”
I said it was—not likely, perhaps, but possible. I also
reminded her that my contract specified a fifty-fifty paperback
split, which meant that if Ballantine or Dell did pay sixty
grand, we’d only get thirty. Tabby didn’t dignify this with a
reply—she didn’t have to. Thirty thousand dollars was what
I could expect to make in four years of teaching, even with
annual salary increases thrown in. It was a lot of money.
Probably just pie in the sky, but it was a night for dreaming.

– 31 –
Carrie inched along toward publication. We spent the
advance on a new car (a standard shift which Tabby hated
84

On Writing

and reviled in her most colorful millworker’s language) and I
signed a teaching contract for the 1973–1974 academic year.
I was writing a new novel, a peculiar combination of Peyton
Place and Dracula which I called Second Coming. We had
moved to a ground-floor apartment back in Bangor, a real
pit, but we were in town again, we had a car covered by an
actual warranty, and we had a telephone.
To tell you the truth, Carrie had fallen off my radar screen
almost completely. The kids were a handful, both the ones at
school and the ones at home, and I had begun to worry about
my mother. She was sixty-one, still working at Pineland
Training Center and as funny as ever, but Dave said she
didn’t feel very well a lot of the time. Her bedside table was
covered with prescription painkillers, and he was afraid there
might be something seriously wrong with her. “She’s always
smoked like a chimney, you know,” Dave said. He was a
great one to talk, since he smoked like a chimney himself (so
did I, and how my wife hated the expense and the constant
ashy dirt of it), but I knew what he meant. And although I
didn’t live as close to her as Dave and didn’t see her as often,
the last time I had seen her I could tell she had lost weight.
“What can we do?” I asked. Behind the question was all we
knew of our mother, who “kept herself to herself,” as she
liked to say. The result of that philosophy was a vast gray space
where other families have histories; Dave and I knew almost
nothing about our father or his family, and little enough
about our own mother’s past, which included an incredible (to
me, at least) eight dead brothers and sisters and her own
failed ambition to become a concert pianist (she did play the
organ on some of the NBC radio soaps and Sunday church
shows during the war, she claimed).
“We can’t do anything,” Dave replied, “until she asks.”
85

Stephen King

One Sunday not long after that call, I got another one
from Bill Thompson at Doubleday. I was alone in the apartment; Tabby had packed the kids off to her mother’s for a
visit, and I was working on the new book, which I thought of
as Vampires in Our Town.
“Are you sitting down?” Bill asked.
“No,” I said. Our phone hung on the kitchen wall, and I
was standing in the doorway between the kitchen and the
living room. “Do I need to?”
“You might,” he said. “The paperback rights to Carrie
went to Signet Books for four hundred thousand dollars.”
When I was a little kid, Daddy Guy had once said to my
mother: “Why don’t you shut that kid up, Ruth? When
Stephen opens his mouth, all his guts fall out.” It was true
then, has been true all my life, but on that Mother’s Day in
May of 1973 I was completely speechless. I stood there in the
doorway, casting the same shadow as always, but I couldn’t
talk. Bill asked if I was still there, kind of laughing as he said
it. He knew I was.
I hadn’t heard him right. Couldn’t have. The idea allowed
me to find my voice again, at least. “Did you say it went for
forty thousand dollars?”
“Four hundred thousand dollars,” he said. “Under the rules
of the road”—meaning the contract I’d signed—“two hundred K of it’s yours. Congratulations, Steve.”
I was still standing in the doorway, looking across the living room toward our bedroom and the crib where Joe slept.
Our place on Sanford Street rented for ninety dollars a month
and this man I’d only met once face-to-face was telling me I’d
just won the lottery. The strength ran out of my legs. I didn’t
fall, exactly, but I kind of whooshed down to a sitting position
there in the doorway.
86

On Writing

“Are you sure?” I asked Bill.
He said he was. I asked him to say the number again, very
slowly and very clearly, so I could be sure I hadn’t misunderstood. He said the number was a four followed by five zeros.
“After that a decimal point and two more zeros,” he added.
We talked for another half an hour, but I don’t remember
a single word of what we said. When the conversation was
over, I tried to call Tabby at her mother’s. Her youngest sister,
Marcella, said Tab had already left. I walked back and forth
through the apartment in my stocking feet, exploding with
good news and without an ear to hear it. I was shaking all
over. At last I pulled on my shoes and walked downtown. The
only store that was open on Bangor’s Main Street was
LaVerdiere’s Drug. I suddenly felt that I had to buy Tabby a
Mother’s Day present, something wild and extravagant. I
tried, but here’s one of life’s true facts: there’s nothing really
wild and extravagant for sale at LaVerdiere’s. I did the best I
could. I got her a hair-dryer.
When I got back home she was in the kitchen, unpacking
the baby bags and singing along with the radio. I gave her
the hair-dryer. She looked at it as if she’d never seen one
before. “What’s this for?” she asked.
I took her by the shoulders. I told her about the paperback
sale. She didn’t appear to understand. I told her again. Tabby
looked over my shoulder at our shitty little four-room apartment, just as I had, and began to cry.

– 32 –
I got drunk for the first time in 1966. This was on the senior
class trip to Washington. We went on a bus, about forty kids
87

Stephen King

and three chaperones (one of them was Old Cue-Ball, as a
matter of fact), and spent the first night in New York, where
the drinking age was then eighteen. Thanks to my bad ears
and shitty tonsils, I was almost nineteen. Room to spare.
A bunch of us more adventurous boys found a package
store around the corner from the hotel. I cast an eye over the
shelves, aware that my spending money was far from a fortune. There was too much—too many bottles, too many
brands, too many prices over ten dollars. Finally I gave up and
asked the guy behind the counter (the same bald, boredlooking, gray-coated guy who has, I’m convinced, sold alcohol virgins their first bottle since the dawn of commerce)
what was cheap. Without a word, he put a pint of Old Log
Cabin whiskey down on the Winston mat beside the cash register. The sticker on the label said $1.95. The price was right.
I have a memory of being led onto the elevator later that
night—or maybe it was early the next morning—by Peter
Higgins (Old Cue-Ball’s son), Butch Michaud, Lenny Partridge, and John Chizmar. This memory is more like a scene
from a TV show than a real memory. I seem to be outside of
myself, watching the whole thing. There’s just enough of me
left inside to know that I am globally, perhaps even galactically, fucked up.
The camera watches as we go up to the girls’ floor. The camera watches as I am propelled up and down the hall, a kind of
rolling exhibit. An amusing one, it seems. The girls are in
nighties, robes, curlers, cold cream. They are all laughing at
me, but their laughter seems good-natured enough. The
sound is muted, as if I am hearing them through cotton. I am
trying to tell Carole Lemke that I love the way she wears her
hair, and that she has the most beautiful blue eyes in the world.
What comes out is something like “Uggin-wuggin-blue eyes,
88

On Writing

wuggin-ruggin-whole world.” Carole laughs and nods as if she
understands completely. I am very happy. The world is seeing
an asshole, no doubt, but he is a happy asshole, and everyone
loves him. I spend several minutes trying to tell Gloria Moore
that I’ve discovered The Secret Life of Dean Martin.
At some point after that I am in my bed. The bed holds
still but the room starts to spin around it, faster and faster. It
occurs to me that it’s spinning like the turntable of my Webcor phonograph, on which I used to play Fats Domino and
now play Dylan and the Dave Clark Five. The room is the
turntable, I am the spindle, and pretty soon the spindle is
going to start tossing its platters.
I go away for a little bit. When I wake up, I’m on my knees
in the bathroom of the double room I’m sharing with my
friend Louis Purington. I have no idea how I got in there, but
it’s good that I did because the toilet is full of bright yellow
puke. Looks like Niblets, I think, and that’s all it takes to get
me going again. Nothing comes up but whiskey-flavored
strings of spit, but my head feels like it’s going to explode. I
can’t walk. I crawl back to bed with my sweaty hair hanging
in my eyes. I’ll feel better tomorrow, I think, and then I go away
again.
In the morning my stomach has settled a little but my
diaphragm is sore from vomiting and my head is throbbing
like a mouthful of infected teeth. My eyes have turned into
magnifying glasses; the hideously bright morning light coming in through the hotel windows is being concentrated by
them and will soon set my brains on fire.
Participating in that day’s scheduled activities—a walk to
Times Square, a boat ride to the Statue of Liberty, a climb to
the top of the Empire State Building—is out of the question.
Walking? Urk. Boats? Double urk. Elevators? Urk to the
89

Stephen King

fourth power. Christ, I can hardly move. I make some sort of
feeble excuse and spend most of the day in bed. By late afternoon I’m feeling a little better. I dress, creep down the hall to
the elevator, and descend to the first floor. Eating is still
impossible, but I believe I’m ready for a ginger ale, a cigarette,
and a magazine. And who should I see in the lobby, sitting in
a chair and reading a newspaper, but Mr. Earl Higgins, alias
Old Cue-Ball. I pass him as silently as I can, but it’s no good.
When I come back from the gift shop he’s sitting with his
newspaper in his lap, looking at me. I feel my stomach drop.
Here is more trouble with the principal, probably even worse
than the trouble I got into over The Village Vomit. He calls me
over and I discover something interesting: Mr. Higgins is
actually an okay guy. He bounced me pretty hard over my
joke newspaper, but perhaps Miss Margitan had insisted on
that. And I’d just been sixteen, after all. On the day of my
first hangover I’m going on nineteen, I’ve been accepted at
the state university, and I have a mill job waiting for me
when the class trip is over.
“I understand you were too sick to tour New York with
the rest of the boys and girls,” Old Cue-Ball says. He eyes me
up and down.
I say that’s right, I’d been sick.
“A shame for you to miss the fun,” Old Cue-Ball says.
“Feeling better now?”
Yes, I was feeling better. Probably stomach flu, one of
those twenty-four-hour bugs.
“I hope you won’t get that bug again,” he says. “At least
not on this trip.” He looks at me for a moment longer, his
eyes asking if we understand each other.
“I’m sure I won’t,” I say, meaning it. I know what drunk is
like, now—a vague sense of roaring goodwill, a clearer sense
90

On Writing

that most of your consciousness is out of your body, hovering
like a camera in a science fiction movie and filming everything, and then the sickness, the puking, the aching head.
No, I won’t get that bug again, I tell myself, not on this trip,
not ever. Once is enough, just to find out what it’s like. Only
an idiot would make a second experiment, and only a
lunatic—a masochistic lunatic—would make booze a regular
part of his life.
The next day we go on to Washington, making one stop in
Amish country on the way. There’s a liquor store near where
the bus parks. I go in and look around. Although the drinking age in Pennsylvania is twenty-one, I must look easily that
in my one good suit and Fazza’s old black overcoat—in fact,
I probably look like a freshly released young convict, tall and
hungry and very likely not bolted together right. The clerk
sells me a fifth of Four Roses without asking to see any ID,
and by the time we stop for the night I’m drunk again.
Ten years or so later I’m in an Irish saloon with Bill Thompson. We have lots to celebrate, not the least of which is the
completion of my third book, The Shining. That’s the one
which just happens to be about an alcoholic writer and exschoolteacher. It’s July, the night of the All-Star baseball
game. Our plan is to eat a good old-fashioned meal from the
dishes set out on the steam table, then get shitfaced. We
begin with a couple at the bar, and I start reading all the signs.
HAVE A MANHATTAN IN MANHATTAN, says one. TUESDAYS ARE TWOFORS,
says another. WORK IS THE CURSE OF THE DRINKING CLASS, says a
third. And there, right in front of me, is one which reads: EARLY
BIRD SPECIAL! SCREWDRIVERS A BUCK MONDAY–FRIDAY 8–10 A.M.
I motion to the bartender. He comes over. He’s bald, he’s
wearing a gray jacket, he could be the guy who sold me my
first pint back in 1966. Probably he is. I point to the sign and
91

Stephen King

ask, “Who comes in at eight-fifteen in the morning and
orders a screwdriver?”
I’m smiling but he doesn’t smile back. “College boys,” he
replies. “Just like you.”

In 1971 or ’72, Mom’s sister Carolyn Weimer died of breast
cancer. My mother and my Aunt Ethelyn (Carolyn’s twin) flew
out to Aunt Cal’s funeral in Minnesota. It was the first time my
mother had flown in twenty years. On the plane trip back, she
began to bleed profusely from what she would have called “her
privates.” Although long past her change of life by that point,
she told herself it was simply one final menstrual period.
Locked in the tiny bathroom of a bouncing TWA jet, she
stanched the bleeding with tampons (plug it up, plug it up, as
Sue Snell and her friends might have cried), then returned to
her seat. She said nothing to Ethelyn and nothing to David and
me. She didn’t go to see Joe Mendes in Lisbon Falls, her
physician since time out of mind. Instead of any of those
things, she did what she always did in times of trouble: kept
herself to herself. For awhile, things seemed to be all right. She
enjoyed her job, she enjoyed her friends, and she enjoyed her
four grandchildren, two from Dave’s family and two from
mine. Then things stopped being all right. In August of
1973, during a checkup following an operation to “strip”
some of her outrageously varicose veins, my mother was diagnosed with uterine cancer. I think Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King,
who once dumped a bowl of Jell-O on the floor and then
danced in it while her two boys lay collapsed in the corner,
screaming with laughter, actually died of embarrassment.
92

On Writing

The end came in February of 1974. By then a little of the
money from Carrie had begun to flow and I was able to help
with some of the medical expenses—there was that much to
be glad about. And I was there for the last of it, staying in the
back bedroom of Dave and Linda’s place. I’d been drunk the
night before but was only moderately hungover, which was
good. One wouldn’t want to be too hungover at the deathbed
of one’s mother.
Dave woke me at 6:15 in the morning, calling softly
through the door that he thought she was going. When I got
into the master bedroom he was sitting beside her on the bed
and holding a Kool for her to smoke. This she did between
harsh gasps for breath. She was only semiconscious, her eyes
going from Dave to me and then back to Dave again. I sat
next to Dave, took the cigarette, and held it to her mouth.
Her lips stretched out to clamp on the filter. Beside her bed,
reflected over and over again in a cluster of glasses, was an
early bound galley of Carrie. Aunt Ethelyn had read it to her
aloud a month or so before she died.
Mom’s eyes went from Dave to me, Dave to me, Dave to
me. She had gone from one hundred and sixty pounds to about
ninety. Her skin was yellow and so tightly stretched that she
looked like one of those mummies they parade through the
streets of Mexico on the Day of the Dead. We took turns holding the cigarette for her, and when it was down to the filter, I
put it out.
“My boys,” she said, then lapsed into what might have
been sleep or unconsciousness. My head ached. I took a couple of aspirin from one of the many bottles of medicine on
her table. Dave held one of her hands and I held the other.
Under the sheet was not the body of our mother but that of a
starved and deformed child. Dave and I smoked and talked a
93

Stephen King

little. I don’t remember what we said. It had rained the night
before, then the temperature had dropped and the morning
streets were filled with ice. We could hear the pause after
each rasping breath she drew growing longer and longer.
Finally there were no more breaths and it was all pause.

My mother was buried out of the Congregational Church at
Southwest Bend; the church she’d attended in Methodist
Corners, where my brother and I grew up, was closed
because of the cold. I gave the eulogy. I think I did a pretty
good job, considering how drunk I was.

– 35 –
Alcoholics build defenses like the Dutch build dikes. I spent
the first twelve years or so of my married life assuring myself
that I “just liked to drink.” I also employed the world-famous
Hemingway Defense. Although never clearly articulated (it
would not be manly to do so), the Hemingway Defense goes
something like this: as a writer, I am a very sensitive fellow, but
I am also a man, and real men don’t give in to their sensitivities. Only sissy-men do that. Therefore I drink. How else can
I face the existential horror of it all and continue to work?
Besides, come on, I can handle it. A real man always can.
Then, in the early eighties, Maine’s legislature enacted a
returnable-bottle and -can law. Instead of going into the
trash, my sixteen-ounce cans of Miller Lite started going into
a plastic container in the garage. One Thursday night I went
94

On Writing

out there to toss in a few dead soldiers and saw that this container, which had been empty on Monday night, was now
almost full. And since I was the only one in the house who
drank Miller Lite—
Holy shit, I’m an alcoholic, I thought, and there was no dissenting opinion from inside my head—I was, after all, the
guy who had written The Shining without even realizing (at
least until that night) that I was writing about myself. My
reaction to this idea wasn’t denial or disagreement; it was
what I’d call frightened determination. You have to be careful,
then, I clearly remember thinking. Because if you fuck up—
If I fucked up, rolled my car over on a back road some
night or blew an interview on live TV, someone would tell me
I ought to get control of my drinking, and telling an alcoholic to control his drinking is like telling a guy suffering the
world’s most cataclysmic case of diarrhea to control his shitting. A friend of mine who has been through this tells an
amusing story about his first tentative effort to get a grip on
his increasingly slippery life. He went to a counsellor and
said his wife was worried that he was drinking too much.
“How much do you drink?” the counsellor asked.
My friend looked at the counsellor with disbelief. “All of
it,” he said, as if that should have been self-evident.
I know how he felt. It’s been almost twelve years since I
took a drink, and I’m still struck by disbelief when I see
someone in a restaurant with a half-finished glass of wine
near at hand. I want to get up, go over, and yell “Finish that!
Why don’t you finish that?” into his or her face. I found the
idea of social drinking ludicrous—if you didn’t want to get
drunk, why not just have a Coke?
My nights during the last five years of my drinking always
ended with the same ritual: I’d pour any beers left in the
95

Stephen King

refrigerator down the sink. If I didn’t, they’d talk to me as I
lay in bed until I got up and had another. And another. And
one more.

– 36 –
By 1985 I had added drug addiction to my alcohol problem,
yet I continued to function, as a good many substance abusers
do, on a marginally competent level. I was terrified not to; by
then I had no idea of how to live any other life. I hid the drugs
I was taking as well as I could, both out of terror—what would
happen to me without dope? I had forgotten the trick of
being straight—and out of shame. I was wiping my ass with
poison ivy again, this time on a daily basis, but I couldn’t ask
for help. That’s not the way you did things in my family. In my
family what you did was smoke your cigarettes and dance in
the Jell-O and keep yourself to yourself.
Yet the part of me that writes the stories, the deep part
that knew I was an alcoholic as early as 1975, when I wrote
The Shining, wouldn’t accept that. Silence isn’t what that
part is about. It began to scream for help in the only way it
knew how, through my fiction and through my monsters. In
late 1985 and early 1986 I wrote Misery (the title quite aptly
described my state of mind), in which a writer is held prisoner and tortured by a psychotic nurse. In the spring and
summer of 1986 I wrote The Tommyknockers, often working
until midnight with my heart running at a hundred and
thirty beats a minute and cotton swabs stuck up my nose to
stem the coke-induced bleeding.
Tommyknockers is a forties-style science fiction tale in which
the writer-heroine discovers an alien spacecraft buried in the
96

On Writing

ground. The crew is still on board, not dead but only hibernating. These alien creatures got into your head and just
started . . . well, tommyknocking around in there. What
you got was energy and a kind of superficial intelligence (the
writer, Bobbi Anderson, creates a telepathic typewriter and an
atomic hot-water heater, among other things). What you
gave up in exchange was your soul. It was the best metaphor
for drugs and alcohol my tired, overstressed mind could come
up with.
Not long after that my wife, finally convinced that I
wasn’t going to pull out of this ugly downward spiral on my
own, stepped in. It couldn’t have been easy—by then I was no
longer within shouting distance of my right mind—but she
did it. She organized an intervention group formed of family
and friends, and I was treated to a kind of This Is Your Life in
hell. Tabby began by dumping a trashbag full of stuff from
my office out on the rug: beercans, cigarette butts, cocaine in
gram bottles and cocaine in plastic Baggies, coke spoons
caked with snot and blood, Valium, Xanax, bottles of Robitussin cough syrup and NyQuil cold medicine, even bottles of
mouthwash. A year or so before, observing the rapidity with
which huge bottles of Listerine were disappearing from the
bathroom, Tabby asked me if I drank the stuff. I responded
with self-righteous hauteur that I most certainly did not.
Nor did I. I drank the Scope instead. It was tastier, had that
hint of mint.
The point of this intervention, which was certainly as
unpleasant for my wife and kids and friends as it was for me,
was that I was dying in front of them. Tabby said I had my
choice: I could get help at a rehab or I could get the hell out
of the house. She said that she and the kids loved me, and for
that very reason none of them wanted to witness my suicide.
97

Stephen King

I bargained, because that’s what addicts do. I was charming, because that’s what addicts are. In the end I got two
weeks to think about it. In retrospect, this seems to summarize all the insanity of that time. Guy is standing on top of a
burning building. Helicopter arrives, hovers, drops a rope
ladder. Climb up! the man leaning out of the helicopter’s door
shouts. Guy on top of the burning building responds, Give me
two weeks to think about it.
I did think, though—as well as I could in my addled
state—and what finally decided me was Annie Wilkes, the
psycho nurse in Misery. Annie was coke, Annie was booze,
and I decided I was tired of being Annie’s pet writer. I was
afraid that I wouldn’t be able to work anymore if I quit
drinking and drugging, but I decided (again, so far as I was
able to decide anything in my distraught and depressed state
of mind) that I would trade writing for staying married and
watching the kids grow up. If it came to that.
It didn’t, of course. The idea that creative endeavor and
mind-altering substances are entwined is one of the great
pop-intellectual myths of our time. The four twentiethcentury writers whose work is most responsible for it are
probably Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Sherwood Anderson, and
the poet Dylan Thomas. They are the writers who largely
formed our vision of an existential English-speaking wasteland where people have been cut off from one another and
live in an atmosphere of emotional strangulation and
despair. These concepts are very familiar to most alcoholics;
the common reaction to them is amusement. Substanceabusing writers are just substance abusers—common garden-variety drunks and druggies, in other words. Any claims
that the drugs and alcohol are necessary to dull a finer sensibility are just the usual self-serving bullshit. I’ve heard alco98

On Writing

holic snowplow drivers make the same claim, that they drink
to still the demons. It doesn’t matter if you’re James Jones,
John Cheever, or a stewbum snoozing in Penn Station; for an
addict, the right to the drink or drug of choice must be preserved at all costs. Hemingway and Fitzgerald didn’t drink
because they were creative, alienated, or morally weak. They
drank because it’s what alkies are wired up to do. Creative
people probably do run a greater risk of alcoholism and
addiction than those in some other jobs, but so what? We all
look pretty much the same when we’re puking in the gutter.

– 37 –
At the end of my adventures I was drinking a case of sixteenounce tallboys a night, and there’s one novel, Cujo, that I
barely remember writing at all. I don’t say that with pride or
shame, only with a vague sense of sorrow and loss. I like that
book. I wish I could remember enjoying the good parts as I
put them down on the page.
At the worst of it I no longer wanted to drink and no
longer wanted to be sober, either. I felt evicted from life. At
the start of the road back I just tried to believe the people who
said that things would get better if I gave them time to do so.
And I never stopped writing. Some of the stuff that came out
was tentative and flat, but at least it was there. I buried
those unhappy, lackluster pages in the bottom drawer of my
desk and got on to the next project. Little by little I found the
beat again, and after that I found the joy again. I came back
to my family with gratitude, and back to my work with
relief—I came back to it the way folks come back to a summer cottage after a long winter, checking first to make sure
99

Stephen King

nothing has been stolen or broken during the cold season.
Nothing had been. It was still all there, still all whole. Once
the pipes were thawed out and the electricity was turned
back on, everything worked fine.

– 38 –
The last thing I want to tell you in this part is about my desk.
For years I dreamed of having the sort of massive oak slab
that would dominate a room—no more child’s desk in a
trailer laundry-closet, no more cramped kneehole in a rented
house. In 1981 I got the one I wanted and placed it in the
middle of a spacious, skylighted study (it’s a converted stable
loft at the rear of the house). For six years I sat behind that
desk either drunk or wrecked out of my mind, like a ship’s
captain in charge of a voyage to nowhere.
A year or two after I sobered up, I got rid of that monstrosity and put in a living-room suite where it had been,
picking out the pieces and a nice Turkish rug with my wife’s
help. In the early nineties, before they moved on to their
own lives, my kids sometimes came up in the evening to
watch a basketball game or a movie and eat pizza. They usually left a boxful of crusts behind when they moved on, but I
didn’t care. They came, they seemed to enjoy being with
me, and I know I enjoyed being with them. I got another
desk—it’s handmade, beautiful, and half the size of the T. rex
desk. I put it at the far west end of the office, in a corner
under the eave. That eave is very like the one I slept under in
Durham, but there are no rats in the walls and no senile
grandmother downstairs yelling for someone to feed Dick the
horse. I’m sitting under it now, a fifty-three-year-old man
100

On Writing

with bad eyes, a gimp leg, and no hangover. I’m doing what
I know how to do, and as well as I know how to do it. I came
through all the stuff I told you about (and plenty more that I
didn’t), and now I’m going to tell you as much as I can about
the job. As promised, it won’t take long.
It starts with this: put your desk in the corner, and every
time you sit down there to write, remind yourself why it isn’t
in the middle of the room. Life isn’t a support-system for art.
It’s the other way around.

101

What Writing Is

Telepathy, of course. It’s amusing when you stop to think
about it—for years people have argued about whether or not
such a thing exists, folks like J. B. Rhine have busted their
brains trying to create a valid testing process to isolate it, and
all the time it’s been right there, lying out in the open like Mr.
Poe’s Purloined Letter. All the arts depend upon telepathy to
some degree, but I believe that writing offers the purest distillation. Perhaps I’m prejudiced, but even if I am we may as
well stick with writing, since it’s what we came here to think
and talk about.
My name is Stephen King. I’m writing the first draft of this
part at my desk (the one under the eave) on a snowy morning
in December of 1997. There are things on my mind. Some are
worries (bad eyes, Christmas shopping not even started, wife
under the weather with a virus), some are good things (our
younger son made a surprise visit home from college, I got to
play Vince Taylor’s “Brand New Cadillac” with The Wallflowers at a concert), but right now all that stuff is up top. I’m
in another place, a basement place where there are lots of
bright lights and clear images. This is a place I’ve built for
myself over the years. It’s a far-seeing place. I know it’s a little strange, a little bit of a contradiction, that a far-seeing place
103

Stephen King

should also be a basement place, but that’s how it is with me.
If you construct your own far-seeing place, you might put it in
a treetop or on the roof of the World Trade Center or on the
edge of the Grand Canyon. That’s your little red wagon, as
Robert McCammon says in one of his novels.
This book is scheduled to be published in the late summer
or early fall of 2000. If that’s how things work out, then you
are somewhere downstream on the timeline from me . . . but
you’re quite likely in your own far-seeing place, the one where
you go to receive telepathic messages. Not that you have to be
there; books are a uniquely portable magic. I usually listen to
one in the car (always unabridged; I think abridged audiobooks are the pits), and carry another wherever I go. You just
never know when you’ll want an escape hatch: mile-long
lines at tollbooth plazas, the fifteen minutes you have to
spend in the hall of some boring college building waiting for
your advisor (who’s got some yank-off in there threatening to
commit suicide because he/she is flunking Custom Kurmfurling 101) to come out so you can get his signature on a
drop-card, airport boarding lounges, laundromats on rainy
afternoons, and the absolute worst, which is the doctor’s
office when the guy is running late and you have to wait half
an hour in order to have something sensitive mauled. At
such times I find a book vital. If I have to spend time in purgatory before going to one place or the other, I guess I’ll be all
right as long as there’s a lending library (if there is it’s probably stocked with nothing but novels by Danielle Steel and
Chicken Soup books, ha-ha, joke’s on you, Steve).
So I read where I can, but I have a favorite place and probably you do, too—a place where the light is good and the
vibe is usually strong. For me it’s the blue chair in my study.
For you it might be the couch on the sunporch, the rocker in
104

On Writing

the kitchen, or maybe it’s propped up in your bed—reading
in bed can be heaven, assuming you can get just the right
amount of light on the page and aren’t prone to spilling your
coffee or cognac on the sheets.
So let’s assume that you’re in your favorite receiving place
just as I am in the place where I do my best transmitting.
We’ll have to perform our mentalist routine not just over
distance but over time as well, yet that presents no real problem; if we can still read Dickens, Shakespeare, and (with the
help of a footnote or two) Herodotus, I think we can manage
the gap between 1997 and 2000. And here we go—actual
telepathy in action. You’ll notice I have nothing up my sleeves
and that my lips never move. Neither, most likely, do yours.
Look—here’s a table covered with a red cloth. On it is a
cage the size of a small fish aquarium. In the cage is a white
rabbit with a pink nose and pink-rimmed eyes. In its front
paws is a carrot-stub upon which it is contentedly munching.
On its back, clearly marked in blue ink, is the numeral 8.
Do we see the same thing? We’d have to get together and
compare notes to make absolutely sure, but I think we do.
There will be necessary variations, of course: some receivers
will see a cloth which is turkey red, some will see one that’s
scarlet, while others may see still other shades. (To colorblind receivers, the red tablecloth is the dark gray of cigar
ashes.) Some may see scalloped edges, some may see straight
ones. Decorative souls may add a little lace, and welcome—
my tablecloth is your tablecloth, knock yourself out.
Likewise, the matter of the cage leaves quite a lot of room
for individual interpretation. For one thing, it is described in
terms of rough comparison, which is useful only if you and I see
the world and measure the things in it with similar eyes. It’s
easy to become careless when making rough comparisons, but
105

Stephen King

the alternative is a prissy attention to detail that takes all the
fun out of writing. What am I going to say, “on the table is a
cage three feet, six inches in length, two feet in width, and
fourteen inches high”? That’s not prose, that’s an instruction
manual. The paragraph also doesn’t tell us what sort of material the cage is made of—wire mesh? steel rods? glass?—but
does it really matter? We all understand the cage is a seethrough medium; beyond that, we don’t care. The most
interesting thing here isn’t even the carrot-munching rabbit
in the cage, but the number on its back. Not a six, not a four,
not nineteen-point-five. It’s an eight. This is what we’re looking at, and we all see it. I didn’t tell you. You didn’t ask
me. I never opened my mouth and you never opened yours.
We’re not even in the same year together, let alone the same
room . . . except we are together. We’re close.
We’re having a meeting of the minds.
I sent you a table with a red cloth on it, a cage, a rabbit,
and the number eight in blue ink. You got them all, especially that blue eight. We’ve engaged in an act of telepathy.
No mythy-mountain shit; real telepathy. I’m not going to
belabor the point, but before we go any further you have
to understand that I’m not trying to be cute; there is a point
to be made.
You can approach the act of writing with nervousness,
excitement, hopefulness, or even despair—the sense that you
can never completely put on the page what’s in your mind
and heart. You can come to the act with your fists clenched
and your eyes narrowed, ready to kick ass and take down
names. You can come to it because you want a girl to marry
you or because you want to change the world. Come to it any
way but lightly. Let me say it again: you must not come lightly to
the blank page.
106

On Writing

I’m not asking you to come reverently or unquestioningly;
I’m not asking you to be politically correct or cast aside your
sense of humor (please God you have one). This isn’t a popularity contest, it’s not the moral Olympics, and it’s not church.
But it’s writing, damn it, not washing the car or putting on
eyeliner. If you can take it seriously, we can do business. If you
can’t or won’t, it’s time for you to close the book and do
something else.
Wash the car, maybe.

TOOLBOX

Grandpa was a carpenter,
he built houses, stores and banks,
he chain-smoked Camel cigarettes
and hammered nails in planks.
He was level-on-the-level,
shaved even every door,
and voted for Eisenhower
’cause Lincoln won the war.
That’s one of my favorite John Prine lyrics, probably because
my grandpa was also a carpenter. I don’t know about stores
and banks, but Guy Pillsbury built his share of houses and
spent a good many years making sure the Atlantic Ocean and
the harsh seacoast winters didn’t wash away the Winslow
Homer estate in Prout’s Neck. Fazza smoked cigars, though,
not Camels. It was my Uncle Oren, also a carpenter, who
smoked the Camels. And when Fazza retired, it was Uncle
Oren who inherited the old fellow’s toolbox. I don’t remember its being there in the garage on the day I dropped the cinderblock on my foot, but it probably was sitting in its
accustomed place just outside the nook where my cousin
Donald kept his hockey sticks, ice skates, and baseball glove.
111

Stephen King

The toolbox was what we called a big ’un. It had three levels, the top two removable, all three containing little drawers
as cunning as Chinese boxes. It was handmade, of course.
Dark wooden slats were bound together by tiny nails and
strips of brass. The lid was held down by big latches; to my
child’s eye they looked like the latches on a giant’s lunchbox.
Inside the top was a silk lining, rather odd in such a context
and made more striking still by the pattern, which was pinkish-red cabbage roses fading into a smog of grease and dirt.
On the sides were great big grabhandles. You never saw a
toolbox like this one for sale at Wal-Mart or Western Auto,
believe me. When my uncle first got it, he found a brass
etching of a famous Homer painting—I believe it was The
Undertow—lying in the bottom. Some years later Uncle Oren
had it authenticated by a Homer expert in New York, and a
few years after that I believe he sold it for a good piece of
money. Exactly how or why Fazza came by the engraving in
the first place is a mystery, but there was no mystery about
the origins of the toolbox—he made it himself.
One summer day I helped Uncle Oren replace a broken
screen on the far side of the house. I might have been eight or
nine at the time. I remember following him with the replacement screen balanced on my head, like a native bearer in a
Tarzan movie. He had the toolbox by the grabhandles, horsing it along at thigh level. As always, Uncle Oren was wearing khaki pants and a clean white tee-shirt. Sweat gleamed in
his graying Army crewcut. A Camel hung from his lower lip.
(When I came in years later with a pack of Chesterfields in my
breast pocket, Uncle Oren sneered at them and called them
“stockade cigarettes.”)
We finally reached the window with the broken screen
and he set the toolbox down with an audible sigh of relief.
112

On Writing

When Dave and I tried to lift it from its place on the garage
floor, each of us holding one of the handles, we could barely
budge it. Of course we were just little kids back then, but
even so I’d guess that Fazza’s fully loaded toolbox weighed
between eighty and a hundred and twenty pounds.
Uncle Oren let me undo the big latches. The common
tools were all on the top layer of the box. There was a hammer, a saw, the pliers, a couple of sized wrenches and an
adjustable; there was a level with that mystic yellow window
in the middle, a drill (the various bits were neatly drawered
farther down in the depths), and two screwdrivers. Uncle
Oren asked me for a screwdriver.
“Which one?” I asked.
“Either-or,” he replied.
The broken screen was held on by loophead screws, and it
really didn’t matter whether he used a regular screwdriver or
the Phillips on them; with loopheads you just stuck the
screwdriver’s barrel through the hole at the top of the screw
and then spun it the way you spin a tire iron once you’ve got
the lugnuts loose.
Uncle Oren took the screws out—there were eight, which
he handed to me for safekeeping—and then removed the old
screen. He set it against the house and held up the new one.
The holes in the screen’s frame mated up neatly with the holes
in the window-frame. Uncle Oren grunted with approval
when he saw this. He took the loophead screws back from me,
one after the other, got them started with his fingers, then
tightened them down just as he’d loosened them, by inserting
the screwdriver’s barrel through the loops and turning them.
When the screen was secure, Uncle Oren gave me the
screwdriver and told me to put it back in the toolbox and
“latch her up.” I did, but I was puzzled. I asked him why he’d
113

Stephen King

lugged Fazza’s toolbox all the way around the house, if all
he’d needed was that one screwdriver. He could have carried
a screwdriver in the back pocket of his khakis.
“Yeah, but Stevie,” he said, bending to grasp the handles,
“I didn’t know what else I might find to do once I got out
here, did I? It’s best to have your tools with you. If you don’t,
you’re apt to find something you didn’t expect and get discouraged.”
I want to suggest that to write to your best abilities, it
behooves you to construct your own toolbox and then build
up enough muscle so you can carry it with you. Then, instead
of looking at a hard job and getting discouraged, you will
perhaps seize the correct tool and get immediately to work.
Fazza’s toolbox had three levels. I think that yours should
have at least four. You could have five or six, I suppose, but
there comes a point where a toolbox becomes too large to be
portable and thus loses its chief virtue. You’ll also want all
those little drawers for your screws and nuts and bolts, but
where you put those drawers and what you put in them . . .
well, that’s your little red wagon, isn’t it? You’ll find you
have most of the tools you need already, but I advise you to
look at each one again as you load it into your box. Try to see
each one new, remind yourself of its function, and if some are
rusty (as they may be if you haven’t done this seriously in
awhile), clean them off.
Common tools go on top. The commonest of all, the bread
of writing, is vocabulary. In this case, you can happily pack
what you have without the slightest bit of guilt and inferiority. As the whore said to the bashful sailor, “It ain’t how
much you’ve got, honey, it’s how you use it.”
Some writers have enormous vocabularies; these are folks

114

On Writing

who’d know if there really is such a thing as an insalubrious
dithyramb or a cozening raconteur, people who haven’t
missed a multiple-choice answer in Wilfred Funk’s It Pays to
Increase Your Word Power in oh, thirty years or so. For example:
The leathery, undeteriorative, and almost indestructible quality was an inherent attribute of the thing’s
form of organization, and pertained to some paleogean
cycle of invertebrate evolution utterly beyond our powers of speculation.
—H. P. Lovecraft, At the Mountains of Madness

Like it? Here’s another:
In some [of the cups] there was no evidence whatever
that anything had been planted; in others, wilted brown
stalks gave testimony to some inscrutable depredation.
—T. Coraghessan Boyle, Budding Prospects

And yet a third—this is a good one, you’ll like it:
Someone snatched the old woman’s blindfold from her
and she and the juggler were clouted away and when the
company turned in to sleep and the low fire was roaring
in the blast like a thing alive these four yet crouched at
the edge of the firelight among their strange chattels and
watched how the ragged flames fled down the wind as if
sucked by some maelstrom out there in the void, some
vortex in that waste apposite to which man’s transit and
his reckonings alike lay abrogate.
—Cormac McCarthy, Blood Meridian

115

Stephen King

Other writers use smaller, simpler vocabularies. Examples
of this hardly seem necessary, but I’ll offer a couple of my
favorites, just the same:
He came to the river. The river was there.
—Ernest Hemingway, “Big Two-Hearted River”

They caught the kid doing something nasty under the
bleachers.
—Theodore Sturgeon, Some of Your Blood

This is what happened.
—Douglas Fairbairn, Shoot

Some of the owner men were kind because they hated
what they had to do, and some of them were angry
because they hated to be cruel, and some of them were
cold because they had long ago found that one could
not be an owner unless one were cold.
—John Steinbeck, The Grapes of Wrath

The Steinbeck sentence is especially interesting. It’s fifty
words long. Of those fifty words, thirty-nine have but one
syllable. That leaves eleven, but even that number is deceptive; Steinbeck uses because three times, owner twice, and
hated twice. There is no word longer than two syllables in
the entire sentence. The structure is complex; the vocabulary
is not far removed from the old Dick and Jane primers. The
Grapes of Wrath is, of course, a fine novel. I believe that Blood
Meridian is another, although there are great whacks of it
that I don’t fully understand. What of that? I can’t decipher
the words to many of the popular songs I love, either.
116

On Writing

There’s also stuff you’ll never find in the dictionary, but
it’s still vocabulary. Check out the following:
“Egggh, whaddaya? Whaddaya want from me?”
“Here come Hymie!”
“Unnh! Unnnh! Unnnhh!”
“Chew my willie, Yo’ Honor.”
“Yeggghhh, fuck you, too, man!”
—Tom Wolfe, Bonfire of the Vanities

This last is phonetically rendered street vocabulary. Few
writers have Wolfe’s ability to translate such stuff to the
page. (Elmore Leonard is another writer who can do it.) Some
street-rap gets into the dictionary eventually, but not until
it’s safely dead. And I don’t think you’ll ever find Yeggghhh
in Webster’s Unabridged.
Put your vocabulary on the top shelf of your toolbox, and
don’t make any conscious effort to improve it. (You’ll be
doing that as you read, of course . . . but that comes later.)
One of the really bad things you can do to your writing is to
dress up the vocabulary, looking for long words because you’re
maybe a little bit ashamed of your short ones. This is like
dressing up a household pet in evening clothes. The pet is
embarrassed and the person who committed this act of premeditated cuteness should be even more embarrassed. Make
yourself a solemn promise right now that you’ll never use
“emolument” when you mean “tip” and you’ll never say John
stopped long enough to perform an act of excretion
when you mean John stopped long enough to take a shit.
If you believe “take a shit” would be considered offensive or
inappropriate by your audience, feel free to say John stopped
long enough to move his bowels (or perhaps John stopped
117

Stephen King

long enough to “push”). I’m not trying to get you to talk
dirty, only plain and direct. Remember that the basic rule of
vocabulary is use the first word that comes to your mind, if it is
appropriate and colorful. If you hesitate and cogitate, you will
come up with another word—of course you will, there’s
always another word—but it probably won’t be as good as
your first one, or as close to what you really mean.
This business of meaning is a very big deal. If you doubt it,
think of all the times you’ve heard someone say “I just can’t
describe it” or “That isn’t what I mean.” Think of all the times
you’ve said those things yourself, usually in a tone of mild or
serious frustration. The word is only a representation of the
meaning; even at its best, writing almost always falls short of
full meaning. Given that, why in God’s name would you
want to make things worse by choosing a word which is only
cousin to the one you really wanted to use?
And do feel free to take appropriateness into account; as
George Carlin once observed, in some company it’s perfectly
all right to prick your finger, but very bad form to finger
your prick.

–2–
You’ll also want grammar on the top shelf of your toolbox,
and don’t annoy me with your moans of exasperation or your
cries that you don’t understand grammar, you never did understand grammar, you flunked that whole semester in Sophomore
English, writing is fun but grammar sucks the big one.
Relax. Chill. We won’t spend much time here because we
don’t need to. One either absorbs the grammatical principles
of one’s native language in conversation and in reading or
118

On Writing

one does not. What Sophomore English does (or tries to do)
is little more than the naming of parts.
And this isn’t high school. Now that you’re not worried
that (a) your skirt is too short or too long and the other kids
will laugh at you, (b) you’re not going to make the varsity
swimming team, (c) you’re still going to be a pimple-studded
virgin when you graduate (probably when you die, for that
matter), (d) the physics teacher won’t grade the final on a
curve, or (e) nobody really likes you anyway AND THEY NEVER
DID . . . now that all that extraneous shit is out of the way, you
can study certain academic matters with a degree of concentration you could never manage while attending the local
textbook loonybin. And once you start, you’ll find you know
almost all of the stuff anyway—it is, as I said, mostly a matter of cleaning the rust off the drillbits and sharpening the
blade of your saw.
Plus . . . oh, to hell with it. If you can remember all the
accessories that go with your best outfit, the contents of your
purse, the starting lineup of the New York Yankees or the
Houston Oilers, or what label “Hang On Sloopy” by The
McCoys was on, you are capable of remembering the difference between a gerund (verb form used as a noun) and a participle (verb form used as an adjective).
I thought long and hard about whether or not to include a
detailed section on grammar in this little book. Part of me
would actually like to; I taught it successfully at high school
(where it hid under the name Business English), and I enjoyed
it as a student. American grammar doesn’t have the sturdiness
of British grammar (a British advertising man with a proper
education can make magazine copy for ribbed condoms sound
like the Magna goddam Carta), but it has its own scruffy
charm.
119

Stephen King

In the end I decided against it, probably for the same reason William Strunk decided not to recap the basics when he
wrote the first edition of The Elements of Style: if you don’t know,
it’s too late. And those really incapable of grasping grammar—
as I am incapable of playing certain guitar riffs and progressions—will have little or no use for a book like this, anyway. In
that sense I am preaching to the converted. Yet allow me to go
on just a little bit further—will you indulge me?
Vocabulary used in speech or writing organizes itself in
seven parts of speech (eight, if you count interjections such as
Oh! and Gosh! and Fuhgeddaboudit!). Communication
composed of these parts of speech must be organized by rules
of grammar upon which we agree. When these rules break
down, confusion and misunderstanding result. Bad grammar
produces bad sentences. My favorite example from Strunk
and White is this one: “As a mother of five, with another
one on the way, my ironing board is always up.”
Nouns and verbs are the two indispensable parts of writing. Without one of each, no group of words can be a sentence, since a sentence is, by definition, a group of words
containing a subject (noun) and a predicate (verb); these
strings of words begin with a capital letter, end with a period,
and combine to make a complete thought which starts in the
writer’s head and then leaps to the reader’s.
Must you write complete sentences each time, every time?
Perish the thought. If your work consists only of fragments
and floating clauses, the Grammar Police aren’t going to
come and take you away. Even William Strunk, that Mussolini of rhetoric, recognized the delicious pliability of language. “It is an old observation,” he writes, “that the best
writers sometimes disregard the rules of rhetoric.” Yet he
goes on to add this thought, which I urge you to consider:
120

On Writing

“Unless he is certain of doing well, [the writer] will probably
do best to follow the rules.”
The telling clause here is Unless he is certain of doing well. If
you don’t have a rudimentary grasp of how the parts of
speech translate into coherent sentences, how can you be certain that you are doing well? How will you know if you’re
doing ill, for that matter? The answer, of course, is that you
can’t, you won’t. One who does grasp the rudiments of
grammar finds a comforting simplicity at its heart, where
there need be only nouns, the words that name, and verbs,
the words that act.
Take any noun, put it with any verb, and you have a sentence. It never fails. Rocks explode. Jane transmits. Mountains float. These are all perfect sentences. Many such
thoughts make little rational sense, but even the stranger ones
(Plums deify!) have a kind of poetic weight that’s nice. The
simplicity of noun-verb construction is useful—at the very
least it can provide a safety net for your writing. Strunk and
White caution against too many simple sentences in a row,
but simple sentences provide a path you can follow when you
fear getting lost in the tangles of rhetoric—all those restrictive
and nonrestrictive clauses, those modifying phrases, those
appositives and compound-complex sentences. If you start to
freak out at the sight of such unmapped territory (unmapped
by you, at least), just remind yourself that rocks explode,
Jane transmits, mountains float, and plums deify. Grammar is
not just a pain in the ass; it’s the pole you grab to get your
thoughts up on their feet and walking. Besides, all those
simple sentences worked for Hemingway, didn’t they? Even
when he was drunk on his ass, he was a fucking genius.
If you want to refurbish your grammar, go to your local
used-book store and find a copy of Warriner’s English Grammar
121

Stephen King

and Composition—the same book most of us took home and
dutifully covered with brown paper shopping-bags when we
were sophomores and juniors in high school. You’ll be relieved
and delighted, I think, to find that almost all you need is summarized on the front and back endpapers of the book.

–3–
Despite the brevity of his style manual, William Strunk found
room to discuss his own dislikes in matters of grammar and
usage. He hated the phrase “student body,” for instance,
insisting that “studentry” was both clearer and without the
ghoulish connotations he saw in the former term. He thought
“personalize” a pretentious word. (Strunk suggests “Get up a
letterhead” to replace “Personalize your stationery.”) He hated
phrases such as “the fact that” and “along these lines.”
I have my own dislikes—I believe that anyone using the
phrase “That’s so cool” should have to stand in the corner and
that those using the far more odious phrases “at this point in
time” and “at the end of the day” should be sent to bed
without supper (or writing-paper, for that matter). Two of my
other pet peeves have to do with this most basic level of
writing, and I want to get them off my chest before we move
along.
Verbs come in two types, active and passive. With an
active verb, the subject of the sentence is doing something.
With a passive verb, something is being done to the subject of
the sentence. The subject is just letting it happen. You should
avoid the passive tense. I’m not the only one who says so; you
can find the same advice in The Elements of Style.
Messrs. Strunk and White don’t speculate as to why so
122

On Writing

many writers are attracted to passive verbs, but I’m willing
to; I think timid writers like them for the same reason timid
lovers like passive partners. The passive voice is safe. There is
no troublesome action to contend with; the subject just has
to close its eyes and think of England, to paraphrase Queen
Victoria. I think unsure writers also feel the passive voice
somehow lends their work authority, perhaps even a quality
of majesty. If you find instruction manuals and lawyers’ torts
majestic, I guess it does.
The timid fellow writes The meeting will be held at
seven o’clock because that somehow says to him, “Put it this
way and people will believe you really know.” Purge this quisling thought! Don’t be a muggle! Throw back your shoulders,
stick out your chin, and put that meeting in charge! Write The
meeting’s at seven. There, by God! Don’t you feel better?
I won’t say there’s no place for the passive tense. Suppose,
for instance, a fellow dies in the kitchen but ends up somewhere else. The body was carried from the kitchen and
placed on the parlor sofa is a fair way to put this, although
“was carried” and “was placed” still irk the shit out of me. I
accept them but I don’t embrace them. What I would embrace
is Freddy and Myra carried the body out of the kitchen
and laid it on the parlor sofa. Why does the body have to be
the subject of the sentence, anyway? It’s dead, for Christ’s sake!
Fuhgeddaboudit!
Two pages of the passive voice—just about any business
document ever written, in other words, not to mention reams
of bad fiction—make me want to scream. It’s weak, it’s circuitous, and it’s frequently tortuous, as well. How about
this: My first kiss will always be recalled by me as how my
romance with Shayna was begun. Oh, man—who farted,
right? A simpler way to express this idea—sweeter and more
123

Stephen King

forceful, as well—might be this: My romance with Shayna
began with our first kiss. I’ll never forget it. I’m not in
love with this because it uses with twice in four words, but at
least we’re out of that awful passive voice.
You might also notice how much simpler the thought is to
understand when it’s broken up into two thoughts. This
makes matters easier for the reader, and the reader must
always be your main concern; without Constant Reader, you
are just a voice quacking in the void. And it’s no walk in the
park being the guy on the receiving end. “[Will Strunk] felt
the reader was in serious trouble most of the time,” E. B.
White writes in his introduction to The Elements of Style, “a
man floundering in a swamp, and that it was the duty of anyone trying to write English to drain this swamp quickly and
get his man up on dry ground, or at least throw him a rope.”
And remember: The writer threw the rope, not The rope
was thrown by the writer. Please oh please.
The other piece of advice I want to give you before moving
on to the next level of the toolbox is this: The adverb is not your
friend.
Adverbs, you will remember from your own version of
Business English, are words that modify verbs, adjectives, or
other adverbs. They’re the ones that usually end in -ly.
Adverbs, like the passive voice, seem to have been created
with the timid writer in mind. With the passive voice, the
writer usually expresses fear of not being taken seriously; it is
the voice of little boys wearing shoepolish mustaches and little girls clumping around in Mommy’s high heels. With
adverbs, the writer usually tells us he or she is afraid he/she
isn’t expressing himself/herself clearly, that he or she is not
getting the point or the picture across.
Consider the sentence He closed the door firmly. It’s by
124

On Writing

no means a terrible sentence (at least it’s got an active verb
going for it), but ask yourself if firmly really has to be there.
You can argue that it expresses a degree of difference between
He closed the door and He slammed the door, and you’ll
get no argument from me . . . but what about context? What
about all the enlightening (not to say emotionally moving)
prose which came before He closed the door firmly? Shouldn’t
this tell us how he closed the door? And if the foregoing prose
does tell us, isn’t firmly an extra word? Isn’t it redundant?
Someone out there is now accusing me of being tiresome
and anal-retentive. I deny it. I believe the road to hell is
paved with adverbs, and I will shout it from the rooftops. To
put it another way, they’re like dandelions. If you have one on
your lawn, it looks pretty and unique. If you fail to root it out,
however, you find five the next day . . . fifty the day after that
. . . and then, my brothers and sisters, your lawn is totally,
completely, and profligately covered with dandelions. By
then you see them for the weeds they really are, but by then
it’s—GASP!!—too late.
I can be a good sport about adverbs, though. Yes I can.
With one exception: dialogue attribution. I insist that you
use the adverb in dialogue attribution only in the rarest and
most special of occasions . . . and not even then, if you can
avoid it. Just to make sure we all know what we’re talking
about, examine these three sentences:
“Put it down!” she shouted.
“Give it back,” he pleaded, “it’s mine.”
“Don’t be such a fool, Jekyll,” Utterson said.

In these sentences, shouted, pleaded, and said are verbs
of dialogue attribution. Now look at these dubious revisions:
125

Stephen King
“Put it down!” she shouted menacingly.
“Give it back,” he pleaded abjectly, “it’s mine.”
“Don’t be such a fool, Jekyll,” Utterson said contemptuously.

The three latter sentences are all weaker than the three
former ones, and most readers will see why immediately.
“Don’t be such a fool, Jekyll,” Utterson said contemptuously is the best of the lot; it is only a cliché, while the other
two are actively ludicrous. Such dialogue attributions are
sometimes known as “Swifties,” after Tom Swift, the brave
inventor-hero in a series of boys’ adventure novels written by
Victor Appleton II. Appleton was fond of such sentences as
“Do your worst!” Tom cried bravely and “My father
helped with the equations,” Tom said modestly. When I
was a teenager there was a party-game based on one’s ability
to create witty (or half-witty) Swifties. “You got a nice butt,
lady,” he said cheekily is one I remember; another is “I’m
the plumber,” he said, with a flush. (In this case the modifier is an adverbial phrase.) When debating whether or not
to make some pernicious dandelion of an adverb part of your
dialogue attribution, I suggest you ask yourself if you really
want to write the sort of prose that might wind up in a partygame.
Some writers try to evade the no-adverb rule by shooting
the attribution verb full of steroids. The result is familiar to
any reader of pulp fiction or paperback originals:
“Put down the gun, Utterson!” Jekyll grated.
“Never stop kissing me!” Shayna gasped.
“You damned tease!” Bill jerked out.

126

On Writing

Don’t do these things. Please oh please.
The best form of dialogue attribution is said, as in he
said, she said, Bill said, Monica said. If you want to see this
put stringently into practice, I urge you to read or reread a
novel by Larry McMurtry, the Shane of dialogue attribution.
That looks damned snide on the page, but I’m speaking with
complete sincerity. McMurtry has allowed few adverbial dandelions to grow on his lawn. He believes in he-said/she-said
even in moments of emotional crisis (and in Larry McMurtry
novels there are a lot of those). Go and do thou likewise.
Is this a case of “Do as I say, not as I do?” The reader has a
perfect right to ask the question, and I have a duty to provide
an honest answer. Yes. It is. You need only look back through
some of my own fiction to know that I’m just another ordinary sinner. I’ve been pretty good about avoiding the passive
tense, but I’ve spilled out my share of adverbs in my time,
including some (it shames me to say it) in dialogue attribution. (I have never fallen so low as “he grated” or “Bill jerked
out,” though.) When I do it, it’s usually for the same reason
any writer does it: because I am afraid the reader won’t
understand me if I don’t.
I’m convinced that fear is at the root of most bad writing.
If one is writing for one’s own pleasure, that fear may be
mild—timidity is the word I’ve used here. If, however, one is
working under deadline—a school paper, a newspaper article, the SAT writing sample—that fear may be intense.
Dumbo got airborne with the help of a magic feather; you
may feel the urge to grasp a passive verb or one of those nasty
adverbs for the same reason. Just remember before you do
that Dumbo didn’t need the feather; the magic was in him.
You probably do know what you’re talking about, and can

127

Stephen King

safely energize your prose with active verbs. And you probably have told your story well enough to believe that when you
use he said, the reader will know how he said it—fast or
slowly, happily or sadly. Your man may be floundering in a
swamp, and by all means throw him a rope if he is . . . but
there’s no need to knock him unconscious with ninety feet of
steel cable.
Good writing is often about letting go of fear and affectation. Affectation itself, beginning with the need to define
some sorts of writing as “good” and other sorts as “bad,” is fearful behavior. Good writing is also about making good choices
when it comes to picking the tools you plan to work with.
No writer is entirely without sin in these matters. Although
William Strunk got E. B. White in his clutches when White
was but a naive undergraduate at Cornell (give them to me
when they’re young and they’re mine forever, heh-heh-heh),
and although White both understood and shared Strunk’s
prejudice against loose writing and the loose thinking which
prompts it, he admits, “I suppose I have written the fact that a
thousand times in the heat of composition, revised it out
maybe five hundred times in the cool aftermath. To be batting
only .500 this late in the season, to fail half the time to connect with this fat pitch, saddens me . . .” Yet E. B. White
went on to write for a good many years following his initial
revisions of Strunk’s “little book” in 1957. I will go on writing in spite of such stupid lapses as “You can’t be serious,”
Bill said unbelievingly. I expect you to do the same thing.
There is a core simplicity to the English language and its
American variant, but it’s a slippery core. All I ask is that you
do as well as you can, and remember that, while to write
adverbs is human, to write he said or she said is divine.

128

On Writing

Lift out the top layer of your toolbox—your vocabulary and
all the grammar stuff. On the layer beneath go those elements
of style upon which I’ve already touched. Strunk and White
offer the best tools (and the best rules) you could hope for,
describing them simply and clearly. (They are offered with a
refreshing strictness, beginning with the rule on how to form
possessives: you always add ’s, even when the word you’re
modifying ends in s—always write Thomas’s bike and never
Thomas’ bike—and ending with ideas about where it’s best
to place the most important parts of a sentence. They say at
the end, and everyone’s entitled to his/her opinion, but I
don’t believe With a hammer he killed Frank will ever
replace He killed Frank with a hammer.)
Before leaving the basic elements of form and style, we
ought to think for a moment about the paragraph, the form
of organization which comes after the sentence. To that end,
grab a novel—preferably one you haven’t yet read—down
from your shelf (the stuff I’m telling you applies to most
prose, but since I’m a fiction writer, it’s fiction I usually think
about when I think about writing). Open the book in the
middle and look at any two pages. Observe the pattern—the
lines of type, the margins, and most particularly the blocks of
white space where paragraphs begin or leave off.
You can tell without even reading if the book you’ve chosen
is apt to be easy or hard, right? Easy books contain lots of
short paragraphs—including dialogue paragraphs which
may only be a word or two long—and lots of white space.

129

They’re as airy as Dairy Queen ice cream cones. Hard books,
ones full of ideas, narration, or description, have a stouter
look. A packed look. Paragraphs are almost as important for
how they look as for what they say; they are maps of intent.
In expository prose, paragraphs can (and should) be neat
and utilitarian. The ideal expository graf contains a topic
sentence followed by others which explain or amplify the
first. Here are two paragraphs from the ever-popular “informal essay” which illustrate this simple but powerful form of
writing:
When I was ten, I feared my sister Megan. It was impossible for her to come into my room without breaking at
least one of my favorite toys, usually the favorite of
favorites. Her gaze had some magical tape-destroying
quality; any poster she looked at seemed to fall off the
wall only seconds later. Well-loved articles of clothing
disappeared from the closet. She didn’t take them (at
least I don’t think so), only made them vanish. I’d usually find that treasured tee-shirt or my favorite Nikes
deep under the bed months later, looking sad and abandoned among the dust kitties. When Megan was in my
room, stereo speakers blew, window-shades flew up with
a bang, and the lamp on my desk usually went dead.
She could be consciously cruel, too. On one occasion,
Megan poured orange juice into my cereal. On another,
she squirted toothpaste into the toes of my socks while
I was taking a shower. And although she never admitted it, I am positive that whenever I fell asleep on the
couch during half-time of the Sunday afternoon pro
football games on TV, she rubbed boogers in my hair.

130

On Writing

Informal essays are, by and large, silly and insubstantial
things; unless you get a job as a columnist at your local newspaper, writing such fluffery is a skill you’ll never use in the
actual mall-and-filling-station world. Teachers assign them
when they can’t think of any other way to waste your time.
The most notorious subject, of course, is “How I Spent My
Summer Vacation.” I taught writing for a year at the University of Maine in Orono and had one class loaded with athletes
and cheerleaders. They liked informal essays, greeting them
like the old high school friends they were. I spent one whole
semester fighting the urge to ask them to write two pages of
well-turned prose on the subject of “If Jesus Were My Teammate.” What held me back was the sure and terrible knowledge that most of them would take to the task with
enthusiasm. Some might actually weep while in the throes of
composition.
Even in the informal essay, however, it’s possible to see
how strong the basic paragraph form can be. Topic-sentencefollowed-by-support-and-description insists that the writer
organize his/her thoughts, and it also provides good insurance against wandering away from the topic. Wandering
isn’t a big deal in an informal essay, is practically de rigueur, as
a matter of fact—but it’s a very bad habit to get into when
working on more serious subjects in a more formal manner.
Writing is refined thinking. If your master’s thesis is no more
organized than a high school essay titled “Why Shania Twain
Turns Me On,” you’re in big trouble.
In fiction, the paragraph is less structured—it’s the beat
instead of the actual melody. The more fiction you read and
write, the more you’ll find your paragraphs forming on their
own. And that’s what you want. When composing it’s best

131

Stephen King

not to think too much about where paragraphs begin and
end; the trick is to let nature take its course. If you don’t like
it later on, fix it then. That’s what rewrite is all about. Now
check out the following:
Big Tony’s room wasn’t what Dale had expected. The
light had an odd yellowish cast that reminded him of
cheap motels he’d stayed in, the ones where he always
seemed to end up with a scenic view of the parking lot.
The only picture was Miss May hanging askew on a
push-pin. One shiny black shoe stuck out from under
the bed.
“I dunno why you keep askin me about O’Leary,” Big
Tony said. “You think my story’s gonna change?”
“Is it?” Dale asked.
“When your story’s true it don’t change. The truth is
always the same boring shit, day in and day out.”
Big Tony sat down, lit a cigarette, ran a hand through
his hair.
“I ain’t seen that fuckin mick since last summer. I let
him hang around because he made me laugh, once
showed me this thing he wrote about what it woulda
been like if Jesus was on his high school football team,
had a picture of Christ in a helmet and kneepads and
everythin, but what a troublesome little fuck he turned
out to be! I wish I’d never seen him!”

We could have a fifty-minute writing class on just this
brief passage. It would encompass dialogue attribution (not
necessary if we know who’s speaking; Rule 17, omit needless
words, in action), phonetically rendered language (dunno,
gonna), the use of the comma (there is none in the line
132

On Writing

When your story’s true it don’t change because I want you
to hear it coming out all in one breath, without a pause), the
decision not to use the apostrophe where the speaker has
dropped a g . . . and all that stuff is just from the top level of
the toolbox.
Let’s stick with the paragraphs, though. Notice how easily
they flow, with the turns and rhythms of the story dictating
where each one begins and ends. The opening graf is of the
classic type, beginning with a topic sentence that is supported by the sentences which follow. Others, however, exist
solely to differentiate between Dale’s dialogue and Big Tony’s.
The most interesting paragraph is the fifth one: Big Tony
sat down, lit a cigarette, ran a hand through his hair. It’s
only a single sentence long, and expository paragraphs almost
never consist of a single sentence. It’s not even a very good sentence, technically speaking; to make it perfect in the Warriner’s
sense, there should be a conjunction (and). Also, what exactly
is the purpose of this paragraph?
First, the sentence may be flawed in a technical sense, but
it’s a good one in terms of the entire passage. Its brevity and
telegraphic style vary the pace and keep the writing fresh.
Suspense novelist Jonathan Kellerman uses this technique
very successfully. In Survival of the Fittest, he writes: The boat
was thirty feet of sleek white fiberglass with gray trim.
Tall masts, the sails tied. Satori painted on the hull in
black script edged with gold.
It is possible to overuse the well-turned fragment (and
Kellerman sometimes does), but frags can also work beautifully to streamline narration, create clear images, and create
tension as well as to vary the prose-line. A series of grammatically proper sentences can stiffen that line, make it less pliable. Purists hate to hear that and will deny it to their dying
133

Stephen King

breath, but it’s true. Language does not always have to wear
a tie and lace-up shoes. The object of fiction isn’t grammatical correctness but to make the reader welcome and then tell
a story . . . to make him/her forget, whenever possible, that
he/she is reading a story at all. The single-sentence paragraph more closely resembles talk than writing, and that’s
good. Writing is seduction. Good talk is part of seduction. If
not so, why do so many couples who start the evening at dinner wind up in bed?
The other uses of this paragraph include stage direction,
minor but useful enhancement of character and setting, and
a vital moment of transition. From protesting that his story is
true, Big Tony moves on to his memories of O’Leary. Since
the source of dialogue doesn’t change, Tony’s sitting down
and lighting up could take place in the same paragraph, with
the dialogue picking up again afterward, but the writer
doesn’t elect to do it that way. Because Big Tony takes a new
tack, the writer breaks the dialogue into two paragraphs. It’s
a decision made instantaneously in the course of writing, one
based entirely on the beat the writer hears in his/her own
head. That beat is part of the genetic hardwiring (Kellerman
writes a lot of frags because he hears a lot of frags), but it’s
also the result of the thousands of hours that writer has spent
composing, and the tens of thousands of hours he/she may
have spent reading the compositions of others.
I would argue that the paragraph, not the sentence, is the
basic unit of writing—the place where coherence begins and
words stand a chance of becoming more than mere words. If
the moment of quickening is to come, it comes at the level of
the paragraph. It is a marvellous and flexible instrument that
can be a single word long or run on for pages (one paragraph
in Don Robertson’s historical novel Paradise Falls is sixteen
134

On Writing

pages long; there are paragraphs in Ross Lockridge’s Raintree
County which are nearly that). You must learn to use it well if
you are to write well. What this means is lots of practice; you
have to learn the beat.

–5–
Grab that book you were looking at off the shelf again, would
you? The weight of it in your hands tells you other stuff that
you can take in without reading a single word. The book’s
length, naturally, but more: the commitment the writer
shouldered in order to create the work, the commitment
Constant Reader must make to digest it. Not that length and
weight alone indicate excellence; many epic tales are pretty
much epic crap—just ask my critics, who will moan about
entire Canadian forests massacred in order to print my drivel.
Conversely, short doesn’t always mean sweet. In some cases
(The Bridges of Madison County, for instance), short means far
too sweet. But there is that matter of commitment, whether a
book is good or bad, a failure or a success. Words have weight.
Ask anyone who works in the shipping department of a book
company warehouse, or in the storage room of a large bookstore.
Words create sentences; sentences create paragraphs; sometimes paragraphs quicken and begin to breathe. Imagine, if
you like, Frankenstein’s monster on its slab. Here comes
lightning, not from the sky but from a humble paragraph of
English words. Maybe it’s the first really good paragraph
you ever wrote, something so fragile and yet full of possibility
that you are frightened. You feel as Victor Frankenstein must
have when the dead conglomeration of sewn-together spare
135

Stephen King

parts suddenly opened its watery yellow eyes. Oh my God, it’s
breathing, you realize. Maybe it’s even thinking. What in hell’s
name do I do next?
You go on to the third level, of course, and begin to write
real fiction. Why shouldn’t you? Why should you fear? Carpenters don’t build monsters, after all; they build houses,
stores, and banks. They build some of wood a plank at a
time and some of brick a brick at a time. You will build a paragraph at a time, constructing these of your vocabulary and
your knowledge of grammar and basic style. As long as you
stay level-on-the-level and shave even every door, you can build
whatever you like—whole mansions, if you have the energy.
Is there any rationale for building entire mansions of words?
I think there is, and that the readers of Margaret Mitchell’s
Gone with the Wind and Charles Dickens’s Bleak House understand it: sometimes even a monster is no monster. Sometimes it’s beautiful and we fall in love with all that story, more
than any film or TV program could ever hope to provide. Even
after a thousand pages we don’t want to leave the world
the writer has made for us, or the make-believe people who live
there. You wouldn’t leave after two thousand pages, if there
were two thousand. The Rings trilogy of J. R. R. Tolkien is a
perfect example of this. A thousand pages of hobbits hasn’t
been enough for three generations of post–World War II fantasy fans; even when you add in that clumsy, galumphing dirigible of an epilogue, The Silmarillion, it hasn’t been enough.
Hence Terry Brooks, Piers Anthony, Robert Jordan, the questing rabbits of Watership Down, and half a hundred others.
The writers of these books are creating the hobbits they still
love and pine for; they are trying to bring Frodo and Sam back
from the Grey Havens because Tolkien is no longer around to
do it for them.

At its most basic we are only discussing a learned skill, but
do we not agree that sometimes the most basic skills can create things far beyond our expectations? We are talking about
tools and carpentry, about words and style . . . but as we

There are no bad dogs, according to the title of a popular
training manual, but don’t tell that to the parent of a child
mauled by a pit bull or a rottweiler; he or she is apt to bust
your beak for you. And no matter how much I want to
encourage the man or woman trying for the first time to
write seriously, I can’t lie and say there are no bad writers.
Sorry, but there are lots of bad writers. Some are on-staff at
your local newspaper, usually reviewing little-theater productions or pontificating about the local sports teams. Some
have scribbled their way to homes in the Caribbean, leaving a
trail of pulsing adverbs, wooden characters, and vile passivevoice constructions behind them. Others hold forth at openmike poetry slams, wearing black turtlenecks and wrinkled
khaki pants; they spout doggerel about “my angry lesbian
breasts” and “the tilted alley where I cried my mother’s
name.”
Writers form themselves into the pyramid we see in all
areas of human talent and human creativity. At the bottom
are the bad ones. Above them is a group which is slightly
smaller but still large and welcoming; these are the competent writers. They may also be found on the staff of your local
newspaper, on the racks at your local bookstore, and at
141

Stephen King

poetry readings on Open Mike Night. These are folks who
somehow understand that although a lesbian may be angry,
her breasts will remain breasts.
The next level is much smaller. These are the really good
writers. Above them—above almost all of us—are the
Shakespeares, the Faulkners, the Yeatses, Shaws, and Eudora
Weltys. They are geniuses, divine accidents, gifted in a way
which is beyond our ability to understand, let alone attain.
Shit, most geniuses aren’t able to understand themselves,
and many of them lead miserable lives, realizing (at least on
some level) that they are nothing but fortunate freaks, the
intellectual version of runway models who just happen to be
born with the right cheekbones and with breasts which fit
the image of an age.
I am approaching the heart of this book with two theses,
both simple. The first is that good writing consists of mastering the fundamentals (vocabulary, grammar, the elements of
style) and then filling the third level of your toolbox with the
right instruments. The second is that while it is impossible to
make a competent writer out of a bad writer, and while it is
equally impossible to make a great writer out of a good one,
it is possible, with lots of hard work, dedication, and timely
help, to make a good writer out of a merely competent one.
I’m afraid this idea is rejected by lots of critics and plenty of
writing teachers, as well. Many of these are liberals in their
politics but crustaceans in their chosen fields. Men and
women who would take to the streets to protest the exclusion
of African-Americans or Native Americans (I can imagine
what Mr. Strunk would have made of these politically correct
but clunky terms) from the local country club are often the
same men and women who tell their classes that writing
ability is fixed and immutable; once a hack, always a hack.
142

On Writing

Even if a writer rises in the estimation of an influential critic
or two, he/she always carries his/her early reputation along,
like a respectable married woman who was a wild child as a
teenager. Some people never forget, that’s all, and a good deal
of literary criticism serves only to reinforce a caste system
which is as old as the intellectual snobbery which nurtured it.
Raymond Chandler may be recognized now as an important
figure in twentieth-century American literature, an early
voice describing the anomie of urban life in the years after
World War II, but there are plenty of critics who will reject
such a judgment out of hand. He’s a hack! they cry indignantly. A hack with pretensions! The worst kind! The kind
who thinks he can pass for one of us!
Critics who try to rise above this intellectual hardening of
the arteries usually meet with limited success. Their colleagues may accept Chandler into the company of the great,
but are apt to seat him at the foot of the table. And there are
always those whispers: Came out of the pulp tradition, you know
. . . carries himself well for one of those, doesn’t he? . . . did you know
he wrote for Black Mask in the thirties . . . yes, regrettable . . .
Even Charles Dickens, the Shakespeare of the novel, has
faced a constant critical attack as a result of his often sensational subject matter, his cheerful fecundity (when he wasn’t
creating novels, he and his wife were creating children), and,
of course, his success with the book-reading groundlings of
his time and ours. Critics and scholars have always been suspicious of popular success. Often their suspicions are justified. In other cases, these suspicions are used as an excuse
not to think. No one can be as intellectually slothful as a
really smart person; give smart people half a chance and they
will ship their oars and drift . . . dozing to Byzantium, you
might say.
143

Stephen King

So yes—I expect to be accused by some of promoting a
brainless and happy Horatio Alger philosophy, defending my
own less-than-spotless reputation while I’m at it, and of
encouraging people who are “just not our sort, old chap” to
apply for membership at the country club. I guess I can live
with that. But before we go on, let me repeat my basic
premise: if you’re a bad writer, no one can help you become a
good one, or even a competent one. If you’re good and want
to be great . . . fuhgeddaboudit.
What follows is everything I know about how to write
good fiction. I’ll be as brief as possible, because your time is
valuable and so is mine, and we both understand that the
hours we spend talking about writing is time we don’t spend
actually doing it. I’ll be as encouraging as possible, because
it’s my nature and because I love this job. I want you to love
it, too. But if you don’t want to work your ass off, you have
no business trying to write well—settle back into competency and be grateful you have even that much to fall back
on. There is a muse,* but he’s not going to come fluttering
down into your writing room and scatter creative fairy-dust
all over your typewriter or computer station. He lives in the
ground. He’s a basement guy. You have to descend to his
level, and once you get down there you have to furnish an
apartment for him to live in. You have to do all the grunt
labor, in other words, while the muse sits and smokes cigars
and admires his bowling trophies and pretends to ignore you.
Do you think this is fair? I think it’s fair. He may not be
much to look at, that muse-guy, and he may not be much of
a conversationalist (what I get out of mine is mostly surly
*Traditionally, the muses were women, but mine’s a guy; I’m afraid we’ll
just have to live with that.
144

On Writing

grunts, unless he’s on duty), but he’s got the inspiration. It’s
right that you should do all the work and burn all the midnight oil, because the guy with the cigar and the little wings
has got a bag of magic. There’s stuff in there that can change
your life.
Believe me, I know.

–1–
If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all
others: read a lot and write a lot. There’s no way around
these two things that I’m aware of, no shortcut.
I’m a slow reader, but I usually get through seventy or
eighty books a year, mostly fiction. I don’t read in order to
study the craft; I read because I like to read. It’s what I do at
night, kicked back in my blue chair. Similarly, I don’t read
fiction to study the art of fiction, but simply because I like
stories. Yet there is a learning process going on. Every book
you pick up has its own lesson or lessons, and quite often the
bad books have more to teach than the good ones.
When I was in the eighth grade, I happened upon a paperback novel by Murray Leinster, a science fiction pulp writer
who did most of his work during the forties and fifties, when
magazines like Amazing Stories paid a penny a word. I had read
other books by Mr. Leinster, enough to know that the quality
of his writing was uneven. This particular tale, which was
about mining in the asteroid belt, was one of his less successful efforts. Only that’s too kind. It was terrible, actually, a
story populated by paper-thin characters and driven by outlandish plot developments. Worst of all (or so it seemed to me
at the time), Leinster had fallen in love with the word zestful.
145

Stephen King

Characters watched the approach of ore-bearing asteroids
with zestful smiles. Characters sat down to supper aboard their
mining ship with zestful anticipation. Near the end of the
book, the hero swept the large-breasted, blonde heroine into
a zestful embrace. For me, it was the literary equivalent of a
smallpox vaccination: I have never, so far as I know, used the
word zestful in a novel or a story. God willing, I never will.
Asteroid Miners (which wasn’t the title, but that’s close
enough) was an important book in my life as a reader. Almost
everyone can remember losing his or her virginity, and most
writers can remember the first book he/she put down thinking: I can do better than this. Hell, I am doing better than this!
What could be more encouraging to the struggling writer
than to realize his/her work is unquestionably better than that
of someone who actually got paid for his/her stuff?
One learns most clearly what not to do by reading bad
prose—one novel like Asteroid Miners (or Valley of the Dolls,
Flowers in the Attic, and The Bridges of Madison County, to name
just a few) is worth a semester at a good writing school, even
with the superstar guest lecturers thrown in.
Good writing, on the other hand, teaches the learning
writer about style, graceful narration, plot development, the
creation of believable characters, and truth-telling. A novel
like The Grapes of Wrath may fill a new writer with feelings of
despair and good old-fashioned jealousy—“I’ll never be able
to write anything that good, not if I live to be a thousand”—
but such feelings can also serve as a spur, goading the writer
to work harder and aim higher. Being swept away by a combination of great story and great writing—of being flattened,
in fact—is part of every writer’s necessary formation. You cannot hope to sweep someone else away by the force of your
writing until it has been done to you.
146

On Writing

So we read to experience the mediocre and the outright rotten; such experience helps us to recognize those things when
they begin to creep into our own work, and to steer clear of
them. We also read in order to measure ourselves against the
good and the great, to get a sense of all that can be done. And
we read in order to experience different styles.
You may find yourself adopting a style you find particularly
exciting, and there’s nothing wrong with that. When I read
Ray Bradbury as a kid, I wrote like Ray Bradbury—everything green and wondrous and seen through a lens smeared
with the grease of nostalgia. When I read James M. Cain,
everything I wrote came out clipped and stripped and hardboiled. When I read Lovecraft, my prose became luxurious
and Byzantine. I wrote stories in my teenage years where all
these styles merged, creating a kind of hilarious stew. This sort
of stylistic blending is a necessary part of developing one’s
own style, but it doesn’t occur in a vacuum. You have to
read widely, constantly refining (and redefining) your own
work as you do so. It’s hard for me to believe that people who
read very little (or not at all in some cases) should presume to
write and expect people to like what they have written, but I
know it’s true. If I had a nickel for every person who ever told
me he/she wanted to become a writer but “didn’t have time to
read,” I could buy myself a pretty good steak dinner. Can I be
blunt on this subject? If you don’t have time to read, you
don’t have the time (or the tools) to write. Simple as that.
Reading is the creative center of a writer’s life. I take a
book with me everywhere I go, and find there are all sorts of
opportunities to dip in. The trick is to teach yourself to read
in small sips as well as in long swallows. Waiting rooms were
made for books—of course! But so are theater lobbies before
the show, long and boring checkout lines, and everyone’s
147

Stephen King

favorite, the john. You can even read while you’re driving,
thanks to the audiobook revolution. Of the books I read each
year, anywhere from six to a dozen are on tape. As for all the
wonderful radio you will be missing, come on—how many
times can you listen to Deep Purple sing “Highway Star”?
Reading at meals is considered rude in polite society, but if
you expect to succeed as a writer, rudeness should be the
second-to-least of your concerns. The least of all should be
polite society and what it expects. If you intend to write as
truthfully as you can, your days as a member of polite society
are numbered, anyway.
Where else can you read? There’s always the treadmill, or
whatever you use down at the local health club to get aerobic.
I try to spend an hour doing that every day, and I think I’d go
mad without a good novel to keep me company. Most exercise
facilities (at home as well as outside it) are now equipped with
TVs, but TV—while working out or anywhere else—really is
about the last thing an aspiring writer needs. If you feel you
must have the news analyst blowhards on CNN while you
exercise, or the stock market blowhards on MSNBC, or the
sports blowhards on ESPN, it’s time for you to question how
serious you really are about becoming a writer. You must be
prepared to do some serious turning inward toward the life of
the imagination, and that means, I’m afraid, that Geraldo,
Keith Obermann, and Jay Leno must go. Reading takes time,
and the glass teat takes too much of it.
Once weaned from the ephemeral craving for TV, most people will find they enjoy the time they spend reading. I’d like to
suggest that turning off that endlessly quacking box is apt to
improve the quality of your life as well as the quality of your
writing. And how much of a sacrifice are we talking about
here? How many Frasier and ER reruns does it take to make
148

On Writing

one American life complete? How many Richard Simmons
infomercials? How many whiteboy/fatboy Beltway insiders on
CNN? Oh man, don’t get me started. Jerry-Springer-Dr.Dre-Judge-Judy-Jerry-Falwell-Donny-and-Marie, I rest my
case.
When my son Owen was seven or so, he fell in love with
Bruce Springsteen’s E Street Band, particularly with Clarence
Clemons, the band’s burly sax player. Owen decided he
wanted to learn to play like Clarence. My wife and I were
amused and delighted by this ambition. We were also hopeful, as any parent would be, that our kid would turn out to be
talented, perhaps even some sort of prodigy. We got Owen a
tenor saxophone for Christmas and lessons with Gordon
Bowie, one of the local music men. Then we crossed our fingers and hoped for the best.
Seven months later I suggested to my wife that it was time
to discontinue the sax lessons, if Owen concurred. Owen did,
and with palpable relief—he hadn’t wanted to say it himself,
especially not after asking for the sax in the first place, but
seven months had been long enough for him to realize that,
while he might love Clarence Clemons’s big sound, the saxophone was simply not for him—God had not given him that
particular talent.
I knew, not because Owen stopped practicing, but because
he was practicing only during the periods Mr. Bowie had set
for him: half an hour after school four days a week, plus an
hour on the weekends. Owen mastered the scales and the
notes—nothing wrong with his memory, his lungs, or his
eye-hand coordination—but we never heard him taking off,
surprising himself with something new, blissing himself out.
And as soon as his practice time was over, it was back into the
case with the horn, and there it stayed until the next lesson or
149

Stephen King

practice-time. What this suggested to me was that when it
came to the sax and my son, there was never going to be any
real play-time; it was all going to be rehearsal. That’s no
good. If there’s no joy in it, it’s just no good. It’s best to go on
to some other area, where the deposits of talent may be richer
and the fun quotient higher.
Talent renders the whole idea of rehearsal meaningless;
when you find something at which you are talented, you do
it (whatever it is) until your fingers bleed or your eyes are
ready to fall out of your head. Even when no one is listening
(or reading, or watching), every outing is a bravura performance, because you as the creator are happy. Perhaps even
ecstatic. That goes for reading and writing as well as for playing a musical instrument, hitting a baseball, or running the
four-forty. The sort of strenuous reading and writing program I advocate—four to six hours a day, every day—will
not seem strenuous if you really enjoy doing these things and
have an aptitude for them; in fact, you may be following
such a program already. If you feel you need permission to do
all the reading and writing your little heart desires, however,
consider it hereby granted by yours truly.
The real importance of reading is that it creates an ease
and intimacy with the process of writing; one comes to the
country of the writer with one’s papers and identification
pretty much in order. Constant reading will pull you into a
place (a mind-set, if you like the phrase) where you can write
eagerly and without self-consciousness. It also offers you a
constantly growing knowledge of what has been done and
what hasn’t, what is trite and what is fresh, what works and
what just lies there dying (or dead) on the page. The more
you read, the less apt you are to make a fool of yourself with
your pen or word processor.

If “read a lot, write a lot” is the Great Commandment—and
I assure you that it is—how much writing constitutes a lot?
That varies, of course, from writer to writer. One of my
favorite stories on the subject—probably more myth than
truth—concerns James Joyce.* According to the story, a
friend came to visit him one day and found the great man
sprawled across his writing desk in a posture of utter despair.
“James, what’s wrong?” the friend asked. “Is it the work?”
Joyce indicated assent without even raising his head to
look at the friend. Of course it was the work; isn’t it always?
“How many words did you get today?” the friend pursued.
Joyce (still in despair, still sprawled facedown on his desk):
“Seven.”
“Seven? But James . . . that’s good, at least for you!”
“Yes,” Joyce said, finally looking up. “I suppose it is . . .
but I don’t know what order they go in!”
At the other end of the spectrum, there are writers like
Anthony Trollope. He wrote humongous novels (Can You Forgive Her? is a fair enough example; for modern audiences it
might be retitled Can You Possibly Finish It?), and he pumped
them out with amazing regularity. His day job was as a clerk
in the British Postal Department (the red public mailboxes all
*There are some great stories about Joyce. My absolute favorite is that, as
his vision failed, he took to wearing a milkman’s uniform while writing.
Supposedly he believed it caught the sunlight and reflected it down on
his page.
151

Stephen King

over Britain were Anthony Trollope’s invention); he wrote for
two and a half hours each morning before leaving for work.
This schedule was ironclad. If he was in mid-sentence when
the two and a half hours expired, he left that sentence unfinished until the next morning. And if he happened to finish
one of his six-hundred-page heavyweights with fifteen minutes of the session remaining, he wrote The End, set the
manuscript aside, and began work on the next book.
John Creasey, a British mystery novelist, wrote five hundred
(yes, you read it correctly) novels under ten different names.
I’ve written thirty-five or so—some of Trollopian length—and
am considered prolific, but I look positively blocked next to
Creasey. Several other contemporary novelists (they include
Ruth Rendell/Barbara Vine, Evan Hunter/Ed McBain, Dean
Koontz, and Joyce Carol Oates) have written easily as much as
I have; some have written a good deal more.
On the other hand—the James Joyce hand—there is
Harper Lee, who wrote only one book (the brilliant To Kill a
Mockingbird). Any number of others, including James Agee,
Malcolm Lowry, and Thomas Harris (so far), wrote under
five. Which is okay, but I always wonder two things about
these folks: how long did it take them to write the books
they did write, and what did they do the rest of their time?
Knit afghans? Organize church bazaars? Deify plums? I’m
probably being snotty here, but I am also, believe me, honestly curious. If God gives you something you can do, why in
God’s name wouldn’t you do it?
My own schedule is pretty clear-cut. Mornings belong to
whatever is new—the current composition. Afternoons are
for naps and letters. Evenings are for reading, family, Red Sox
games on TV, and any revisions that just cannot wait. Basically, mornings are my prime writing time.
152

On Writing

Once I start work on a project, I don’t stop and I don’t
slow down unless I absolutely have to. If I don’t write every
day, the characters begin to stale off in my mind—they begin
to seem like characters instead of real people. The tale’s narrative cutting edge starts to rust and I begin to lose my hold on
the story’s plot and pace. Worst of all, the excitement of
spinning something new begins to fade. The work starts to feel
like work, and for most writers that is the smooch of death.
Writing is at its best—always, always, always—when it is a
kind of inspired play for the writer. I can write in cold blood
if I have to, but I like it best when it’s fresh and almost too
hot to handle.
I used to tell interviewers that I wrote every day except for
Christmas, the Fourth of July, and my birthday. That was a
lie. I told them that because if you agree to an interview you
have to say something, and it plays better if it’s something at
least half-clever. Also, I didn’t want to sound like a workaholic
dweeb (just a workaholic, I guess). The truth is that when I’m
writing, I write every day, workaholic dweeb or not. That
includes Christmas, the Fourth, and my birthday (at my age
you try to ignore your goddam birthday anyway). And when
I’m not working, I’m not working at all, although during
those periods of full stop I usually feel at loose ends with
myself and have trouble sleeping. For me, not working is
the real work. When I’m writing, it’s all the playground,
and the worst three hours I ever spent there were still pretty
damned good.
I used to be faster than I am now; one of my books (The
Running Man) was written in a single week, an accomplishment John Creasey would perhaps have appreciated (although
I have read that Creasey wrote several of his mysteries in two
days). I think it was quitting smoking that slowed me down;
153

Stephen King

nicotine is a great synapse enhancer. The problem, of course,
is that it’s killing you at the same time it’s helping you compose. Still, I believe the first draft of a book—even a long
one—should take no more than three months, the length of
a season. Any longer and—for me, at least—the story begins
to take on an odd foreign feel, like a dispatch from the
Romanian Department of Public Affairs, or something broadcast on high-band shortwave during a period of severe sunspot
activity.
I like to get ten pages a day, which amounts to 2,000
words. That’s 180,000 words over a three-month span, a
goodish length for a book—something in which the reader
can get happily lost, if the tale is done well and stays fresh.
On some days those ten pages come easily; I’m up and out
and doing errands by eleven-thirty in the morning, perky as
a rat in liverwurst. More frequently, as I grow older, I find
myself eating lunch at my desk and finishing the day’s work
around one-thirty in the afternoon. Sometimes, when the
words come hard, I’m still fiddling around at teatime. Either
way is fine with me, but only under dire circumstances do I
allow myself to shut down before I get my 2,000 words.
The biggest aid to regular (Trollopian?) production is
working in a serene atmosphere. It’s difficult for even the
most naturally productive writer to work in an environment
where alarms and excursions are the rule rather than the
exception. When I’m asked for “the secret of my success” (an
absurd idea, that, but impossible to get away from), I sometimes say there are two: I stayed physically healthy (at least
until a van knocked me down by the side of the road in the
summer of 1999), and I stayed married. It’s a good answer
because it makes the question go away, and because there is
an element of truth in it. The combination of a healthy body
154

On Writing

and a stable relationship with a self-reliant woman who takes
zero shit from me or anyone else has made the continuity of
my working life possible. And I believe the converse is also
true: that my writing and the pleasure I take in it has contributed to the stability of my health and my home life.

–3–
You can read anywhere, almost, but when it comes to writing, library carrels, park benches, and rented flats should be
courts of last resort—Truman Capote said he did his best
work in motel rooms, but he is an exception; most of us do
our best in a place of our own. Until you get one, you’ll find
your new resolution to write a lot hard to take seriously.
Your writing room doesn’t have to sport a Playboy Philosophy decor, and you don’t need an Early American rolltop
desk in which to house your writing implements. I wrote my
first two published novels, Carrie and ’Salem’s Lot, in the
laundry room of a doublewide trailer, pounding away on my
wife’s portable Olivetti typewriter and balancing a child’s
desk on my thighs; John Cheever reputedly wrote in the
basement of his Park Avenue apartment building, near the
furnace. The space can be humble (probably should be, as I
think I have already suggested), and it really needs only one
thing: a door which you are willing to shut. The closed door
is your way of telling the world and yourself that you mean
business; you have made a serious commitment to write and
intend to walk the walk as well as talk the talk.
By the time you step into your new writing space and
close the door, you should have settled on a daily writing
goal. As with physical exercise, it would be best to set this
155

Stephen King

goal low at first, to avoid discouragement. I suggest a thousand words a day, and because I’m feeling magnanimous, I’ll
also suggest that you can take one day a week off, at least to
begin with. No more; you’ll lose the urgency and immediacy
of your story if you do. With that goal set, resolve to yourself
that the door stays closed until that goal is met. Get busy
putting those thousand words on paper or on a floppy disk.
In an early interview (this was to promote Carrie, I think), a
radio talk-show host asked me how I wrote. My reply—“One
word at a time”—seemingly left him without a reply. I think
he was trying to decide whether or not I was joking. I wasn’t.
In the end, it’s always that simple. Whether it’s a vignette of
a single page or an epic trilogy like The Lord of the Rings, the
work is always accomplished one word at a time. The door
closes the rest of the world out; it also serves to close you in
and keep you focused on the job at hand.
If possible, there should be no telephone in your writing
room, certainly no TV or videogames for you to fool around
with. If there’s a window, draw the curtains or pull down the
shades unless it looks out at a blank wall. For any writer, but
for the beginning writer in particular, it’s wise to eliminate
every possible distraction. If you continue to write, you will
begin to filter out these distractions naturally, but at the start
it’s best to try and take care of them before you write. I work
to loud music—hard-rock stuff like AC/DC, Guns ’n Roses,
and Metallica have always been particular favorites—but for
me the music is just another way of shutting the door. It surrounds me, keeps the mundane world out. When you write,
you want to get rid of the world, do you not? Of course you
do. When you’re writing, you’re creating your own worlds.
I think we’re actually talking about creative sleep. Like your
bedroom, your writing room should be private, a place where
156

On Writing

you go to dream. Your schedule—in at about the same time
every day, out when your thousand words are on paper or
disk—exists in order to habituate yourself, to make yourself
ready to dream just as you make yourself ready to sleep by
going to bed at roughly the same time each night and following the same ritual as you go. In both writing and sleeping,
we learn to be physically still at the same time we are encouraging our minds to unlock from the humdrum rational thinking of our daytime lives. And as your mind and body grow
accustomed to a certain amount of sleep each night—six
hours, seven, maybe the recommended eight—so can you train
your waking mind to sleep creatively and work out the vividly
imagined waking dreams which are successful works of fiction.
But you need the room, you need the door, and you need the
determination to shut the door. You need a concrete goal, as
well. The longer you keep to these basics, the easier the act of
writing will become. Don’t wait for the muse. As I’ve said, he’s
a hardheaded guy who’s not susceptible to a lot of creative fluttering. This isn’t the Ouija board or the spirit-world we’re talking about here, but just another job like laying pipe or driving
long-haul trucks. Your job is to make sure the muse knows
where you’re going to be every day from nine ’til noon or seven
’til three. If he does know, I assure you that sooner or later he’ll
start showing up, chomping his cigar and making his magic.

So okay—there you are in your room with the shade down
and the door shut and the plug pulled out of the base of the
telephone. You’ve blown up your TV and committed yourself to a thousand words a day, come hell or high water. Now
157

Stephen King

comes the big question: What are you going to write about?
And the equally big answer: Anything you damn well want.
Anything at all . . . as long as you tell the truth.
The dictum in writing classes used to be “write what you
know.” Which sounds good, but what if you want to write
about starships exploring other planets or a man who murders his wife and then tries to dispose of her body with a
wood-chipper? How does the writer square either of these, or
a thousand other fanciful ideas, with the “write-what-youknow” directive?
I think you begin by interpreting “write what you know”
as broadly and inclusively as possible. If you’re a plumber,
you know plumbing, but that is far from the extent of your
knowledge; the heart also knows things, and so does the
imagination. Thank God. If not for heart and imagination,
the world of fiction would be a pretty seedy place. It might
not even exist at all.
In terms of genre, it’s probably fair to assume that you will
begin by writing what you love to read—certainly I have
recounted my early love affair with the EC horror comics
until the tale has gone stale. But I did love them, ditto horror
movies like I Married a Monster from Outer Space, and the result
was stories like “I Was a Teenage Graverobber.” Even today
I’m not above writing slightly more sophisticated versions of
that tale; I was built with a love of the night and the unquiet
coffin, that’s all. If you disapprove, I can only shrug my
shoulders. It’s what I have.
If you happen to be a science fiction fan, it’s natural that
you should want to write science fiction (and the more sf
you’ve read, the less likely it is that you’ll simply revisit the
field’s well-mined conventions, such as space opera and
dystopian satire). If you’re a mystery fan, you’ll want to write
158

On Writing

mysteries, and if you enjoy romances, it’s natural for you to
want to write romances of your own. There’s nothing wrong
with writing any of these things. What would be very wrong,
I think, is to turn away from what you know and like (or love,
the way I loved those old ECs and black-and-white horror
flicks) in favor of things you believe will impress your friends,
relatives, and writing-circle colleagues. What’s equally wrong
is the deliberate turning toward some genre or type of fiction
in order to make money. It’s morally wonky, for one thing—
the job of fiction is to find the truth inside the story’s web of
lies, not to commit intellectual dishonesty in the hunt for the
buck. Also, brothers and sisters, it doesn’t work.
When I’m asked why I decided to write the sort of thing I
do write, I always think the question is more revealing than
any answer I could possibly give. Wrapped within it, like the
chewy stuff in the center of a Tootsie Pop, is the assumption
that the writer controls the material instead of the other way
around.* The writer who is serious and committed is incapable of sizing up story material the way an investor might
size up various stock offerings, picking out the ones which
seem likely to provide a good return. If it could indeed be
done that way, every novel published would be a best-seller
and the huge advances paid to a dozen or so “big-name writers” would not exist (publishers would like that).
Grisham, Clancy, Crichton, and myself—among others—
are paid these large sums of money because we are selling
uncommonly large numbers of books to uncommonly large
*Kirby McCauley, my first real agent, used to quote science fiction writer
Alfred Bester (The Stars My Destination, The Demolished Man) on this subject. “The book is the boss,” Alfie used to say in tones indicating that that
closed the subject.
159

Stephen King

audiences. A critical assumption is sometimes made that we
have access to some mystical vulgate that other (and often
better) writers either cannot find or will not deign to use. I
doubt if this is true. Nor do I believe the contention of some
popular novelists (although she was not the only one, I am
thinking of the late Jacqueline Susann) that their success is
based on literary merit—that the public understands true
greatness in ways the tight-assed, consumed-by-jealousy literary establishment cannot. This idea is ridiculous, a product
of vanity and insecurity.
Book-buyers aren’t attracted, by and large, by the literary
merits of a novel; book-buyers want a good story to take
with them on the airplane, something that will first fascinate
them, then pull them in and keep them turning the pages.
This happens, I think, when readers recognize the people in a
book, their behaviors, their surroundings, and their talk.
When the reader hears strong echoes of his or her own life and
beliefs, he or she is apt to become more invested in the story.
I’d argue that it’s impossible to make this sort of connection
in a premeditated way, gauging the market like a racetrack
tout with a hot tip.
Stylistic imitation is one thing, a perfectly honorable way
to get started as a writer (and impossible to avoid, really;
some sort of imitation marks each new stage of a writer’s
development), but one cannot imitate a writer’s approach to
a particular genre, no matter how simple what that writer is
doing may seem. You can’t aim a book like a cruise missile, in
other words. People who decide to make a fortune writing
like John Grisham or Tom Clancy produce nothing but pale
imitations, by and large, because vocabulary is not the same
thing as feeling and plot is light-years from the truth as it is
understood by the mind and the heart. When you see a novel
160

On Writing

with “In the tradition of (John Grisham/Patricia Cornwell/Mary Higgins Clark/Dean Koontz)” on the cover, you
know you are looking at one of these overcalculated (and
likely boring) imitations.
Write what you like, then imbue it with life and make it
unique by blending in your own personal knowledge of life,
friendship, relationships, sex, and work. Especially work. People love to read about work. God knows why, but they do. If
you’re a plumber who enjoys science fiction, you might well
consider a novel about a plumber aboard a starship or on an
alien planet. Sound ludicrous? The late Clifford D. Simak
wrote a novel called Cosmic Engineers which is close to just that.
And it’s a terrific read. What you need to remember is that
there’s a difference between lecturing about what you know
and using it to enrich the story. The latter is good. The former
is not.
Consider John Grisham’s breakout novel, The Firm. In this
story, a young lawyer discovers that his first job, which seemed
too good to be true, really is—he’s working for the Mafia.
Suspenseful, involving, and paced at breakneck speed, The
Firm sold roughly nine gazillion copies. What seemed to fascinate its audience was the moral dilemma in which the
young lawyer finds himself: working for the mob is bad, no
argument there, but the frocking pay is great! You can drive a
Beemer, and that’s just for openers!
Audiences also enjoyed the lawyer’s resourceful efforts to
extricate himself from his dilemma. It might not be the way
most people would behave, and the deus ex machina clanks
pretty steadily in the last fifty pages, but it is the way most of
us would like to behave. And wouldn’t we also like to have a
deus ex machina in our lives?
Although I don’t know for sure, I’d bet my dog and lot
161

Stephen King

that John Grisham never worked for the mob. All of that is
total fabrication (and total fabrication is the fiction-writer’s
purest delight). He was once a young lawyer, though, and he
has clearly forgotten none of the struggle. Nor has he forgotten the location of the various financial pitfalls and honeytraps that make the field of corporate law so difficult. Using
plainspun humor as a brilliant counterpoint and never substituting cant for story, he sketches a world of Darwinian
struggle where all the savages wear three-piece suits. And—
here’s the good part—this is a world impossible not to believe.
Grisham has been there, spied out the land and the enemy
positions, and brought back a full report. He told the truth
of what he knew, and for that if nothing else, he deserves
every buck The Firm made.
Critics who dismissed The Firm and Grisham’s later books
as poorly written and who profess themselves to be mystified
by his success are either missing the point because it’s so big
and obvious or because they are being deliberately obtuse.
Grisham’s make-believe tale is solidly based in a reality he
knows, has personally experienced, and which he wrote about
with total (almost naive) honesty. The result is a book which
is—cardboard characters or no, we could argue about that—
both brave and uniquely satisfying. You as a beginning writer
would do well not to imitate the lawyers-in-trouble genre
Grisham seems to have created but to emulate Grisham’s
openness and inability to do anything other than get right to
the point.
John Grisham, of course, knows lawyers. What you know
makes you unique in some other way. Be brave. Map the
enemy’s positions, come back, tell us all you know. And
remember that plumbers in space is not such a bad setup for
a story.

In my view, stories and novels consist of three parts: narration, which moves the story from point A to point B and
finally to point Z; description, which creates a sensory reality
for the reader; and dialogue, which brings characters to life
through their speech.
You may wonder where plot is in all this. The answer—my
answer, anyway—is nowhere. I won’t try to convince you that
I’ve never plotted any more than I’d try to convince you that
I’ve never told a lie, but I do both as infrequently as possible. I
distrust plot for two reasons: first, because our lives are largely
plotless, even when you add in all our reasonable precautions
and careful planning; and second, because I believe plotting
and the spontaneity of real creation aren’t compatible. It’s
best that I be as clear about this as I can—I want you to
understand that my basic belief about the making of stories is
that they pretty much make themselves. The job of the writer
is to give them a place to grow (and to transcribe them, of
course). If you can see things this way (or at least try to), we
can work together comfortably. If, on the other hand, you
decide I’m crazy, that’s fine. You won’t be the first.
When, during the course of an interview for The New
Yorker, I told the interviewer (Mark Singer) that I believed stories are found things, like fossils in the ground, he said that he
didn’t believe me. I replied that that was fine, as long as he
believed that I believe it. And I do. Stories aren’t souvenir teeshirts or GameBoys. Stories are relics, part of an undiscovered
pre-existing world. The writer’s job is to use the tools in his or
her toolbox to get as much of each one out of the ground
163

Stephen King

intact as possible. Sometimes the fossil you uncover is small;
a seashell. Sometimes it’s enormous, a Tyrannosaurus Rex with
all those gigantic ribs and grinning teeth. Either way, short
story or thousand-page whopper of a novel, the techniques of
excavation remain basically the same.
No matter how good you are, no matter how much experience you have, it’s probably impossible to get the entire fossil out of the ground without a few breaks and losses. To get
even most of it, the shovel must give way to more delicate
tools: airhose, palm-pick, perhaps even a toothbrush. Plot is
a far bigger tool, the writer’s jackhammer. You can liberate a
fossil from hard ground with a jackhammer, no argument
there, but you know as well as I do that the jackhammer is
going to break almost as much stuff as it liberates. It’s clumsy,
mechanical, anticreative. Plot is, I think, the good writer’s last
resort and the dullard’s first choice. The story which results
from it is apt to feel artificial and labored.
I lean more heavily on intuition, and have been able to do
that because my books tend to be based on situation rather
than story. Some of the ideas which have produced those
books are more complex than others, but the majority start out
with the stark simplicity of a department store window display
or a waxwork tableau. I want to put a group of characters (perhaps a pair; perhaps even just one) in some sort of predicament
and then watch them try to work themselves free. My job isn’t
to help them work their way free, or manipulate them to
safety—those are jobs which require the noisy jackhammer of
plot—but to watch what happens and then write it down.
The situation comes first. The characters—always flat and
unfeatured, to begin with—come next. Once these things are
fixed in my mind, I begin to narrate. I often have an idea of
what the outcome may be, but I have never demanded of a set
164

On Writing

of characters that they do things my way. On the contrary, I
want them to do things their way. In some instances, the
outcome is what I visualized. In most, however, it’s something
I never expected. For a suspense novelist, this is a great thing.
I am, after all, not just the novel’s creator but its first reader.
And if I’m not able to guess with any accuracy how the
damned thing is going to turn out, even with my inside
knowledge of coming events, I can be pretty sure of keeping
the reader in a state of page-turning anxiety. And why worry
about the ending anyway? Why be such a control freak?
Sooner or later every story comes out somewhere.
In the early 1980s, my wife and I went to London on a
combined business/pleasure trip. I fell asleep on the plane and
had a dream about a popular writer (it may or may not have
been me, but it sure to God wasn’t James Caan) who fell into
the clutches of a psychotic fan living on a farm somewhere out
in the back of the beyond. The fan was a woman isolated by
her growing paranoia. She kept some livestock in the barn,
including her pet pig, Misery. The pig was named after the
continuing main character in the writer’s best-selling bodicerippers. My clearest memory of this dream upon waking was
something the woman said to the writer, who had a broken
leg and was being kept prisoner in the back bedroom. I wrote
it on an American Airlines cocktail napkin so I wouldn’t forget it, then put it in my pocket. I lost it somewhere, but can
remember most of what I wrote down:
She speaks earnestly but never quite makes eye contact. A big
woman and solid all through; she is an absence of hiatus. (Whatever that means; remember, I’d just woken up.) “I wasn’t trying to be funny in a mean way when I named my pig Misery, no sir.
Please don’t think that. No, I named her in the spirit of fan love,
which is the purest love there is. You should be flattered.”

Tabby and I stayed at Brown’s Hotel in London, and on
our first night there I was unable to sleep. Some of it was
what sounded like a trio of little-girl gymnasts in the room
directly above ours, some of it was undoubtedly jet lag, but a
lot of it was that airline cocktail napkin. Jotted on it was the
seed of what I thought could be a really excellent story, one
that might turn out funny and satiric as well as scary. I
thought it was just too rich not to write.
I got up, went downstairs, and asked the concierge if there
was a quiet place where I could work longhand for a bit. He
led me to a gorgeous desk on the second-floor stair landing.
It had been Rudyard Kipling’s desk, he told me with perhaps
justifiable pride. I was a little intimidated by this intelligence, but the spot was quiet and the desk seemed hospitable enough; it featured about an acre of cherrywood
working surface, for one thing. Stoked on cup after cup of tea
(I drank it by the gallon when I wrote . . . unless I was drinking beer, that is), I filled sixteen pages of a steno notebook. I
like to work longhand, actually; the only problem is that,
once I get jazzed, I can’t keep up with the lines forming in
my head and I get frazzled.
When I called it quits, I stopped in the lobby to thank the
concierge again for letting me use Mr. Kipling’s beautiful
desk. “I’m so glad you enjoyed it,” he replied. He was wearing a misty, reminiscent little smile, as if he had known the
writer himself. “Kipling died there, actually. Of a stroke.
While he was writing.”
I went back upstairs to catch a few hours’ sleep, thinking
of how often we are given information we really could have
done without.
The working title of my story, which I thought would be a
novella of about 30,000 words, was “The Annie Wilkes Edi166

On Writing

tion.” When I sat down at Mr. Kipling’s beautiful desk I had
the basic situation—crippled writer, psycho fan—firmly
fixed in my mind. The actual story did not as then exist (well,
it did, but as a relic buried—except for sixteen handwritten
pages, that is—in the earth), but knowing the story wasn’t
necessary for me to begin work. I had located the fossil; the
rest, I knew, would consist of careful excavation.
I’d suggest that what works for me may work equally well
for you. If you are enslaved to (or intimidated by) the tiresome tyranny of the outline and the notebook filled with
“Character Notes,” it may liberate you. At the very least, it
will turn your mind to something more interesting than
Developing the Plot.
(An amusing sidelight: the century’s greatest supporter
of Developing the Plot may have been Edgar Wallace, a bestselling potboiler novelist of the 1920s. Wallace invented—
and patented—a device called the Edgar Wallace Plot Wheel.
When you got stuck for the next Plot Development or needed
an Amazing Turn of Events in a hurry, you simply spun the
Plot Wheel and read what came up in the window: a fortuitous arrival, perhaps, or Heroine declares her love. These
gadgets apparently sold like hotcakes.)
By the time I had finished that first Brown’s Hotel session,
in which Paul Sheldon wakes up to find himself Annie Wilkes’s
prisoner, I thought I knew what was going to happen. Annie
would demand that Paul write another novel about his plucky
continuing character, Misery Chastain, one just for her. After
first demurring, Paul would of course agree (a psychotic nurse,
I thought, could be very persuasive). Annie would tell him she
intended to sacrifice her beloved pig, Misery, to this project.
Misery’s Return would, she’d say, consist of but one copy: a holographic manuscript bound in pigskin!
167

Stephen King

Here we’d fade out, I thought, and return to Annie’s
remote Colorado retreat six or eight months later for the surprise ending.
Paul is gone, his sickroom turned into a shrine to Misery
Chastain, but Misery the pig is still very much in evidence,
grunting serenely away in her sty beside the barn. On the
walls of the “Misery Room” are book covers, stills from the
Misery movies, pictures of Paul Sheldon, perhaps a newspaper headline reading FAMED ROMANCE NOVELIST STILL MISSING. In
the center of the room, carefully spotlighted, is a single book
on a small table (a cherrywood table, of course, in honor of
Mr. Kipling). It is the Annie Wilkes Edition of Misery’s
Return. The binding is beautiful, and it should be; it is the
skin of Paul Sheldon. And Paul himself? His bones might be
buried behind the barn, but I thought it likely that the pig
would have eaten the tasty parts.
Not bad, and it would have made a pretty good story (not
such a good novel, however; no one likes to root for a guy
over the course of three hundred pages only to discover that
between chapters sixteen and seventeen the pig ate him), but
that wasn’t the way things eventually went. Paul Sheldon
turned out to be a good deal more resourceful than I initially
thought, and his efforts to play Scheherazade and save his life
gave me a chance to say some things about the redemptive
power of writing that I had long felt but never articulated.
Annie also turned out to be more complex than I’d first
imagined her, and she was great fun to write about—here
was a woman pretty much stuck with “cockadoodie brat”
when it came to profanity, but who felt absolutely no qualms
about chopping off her favorite writer’s foot when he tried to
get away from her. In the end, I felt that Annie was almost as
much to be pitied as to be feared. And none of the story’s
168

On Writing

details and incidents proceeded from plot; they were organic,
each arising naturally from the initial situation, each an
uncovered part of the fossil. And I’m writing all this with a
smile. As sick with drugs and alcohol as I was much of the
time, I had such fun with that one.
Gerald’s Game and The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon are two
other purely situational novels. If Misery is “two characters in
a house,” then Gerald is “one woman in a bedroom” and The
Girl Who is “one kid lost in the woods.” As I told you, I have
written plotted novels, but the results, in books like Insomnia
and Rose Madder, have not been particularly inspiring. These are
(much as I hate to admit it) stiff, trying-too-hard novels. The
only plot-driven novel of mine which I really like is The Dead
Zone (and in all fairness, I must say I like that one a great deal).
One book which seems plotted—Bag of Bones—is actually
another situation: “widowed writer in a haunted house.” The
back story of Bag of Bones is satisfyingly gothic (at least I
think so) and very complex, but none of the details were premeditated. The history of TR-90 and the story of what widowed writer Mike Noonan’s wife was really up to during the
last summer of her life arose spontaneously—all those details
were parts of the fossil, in other words.
A strong enough situation renders the whole question of
plot moot, which is fine with me. The most interesting situations can usually be expressed as a What-if question:
What if vampires invaded a small New England village?
(’Salem’s Lot)
What if a policeman in a remote Nevada town went
berserk and started killing everyone in sight? (Desperation)
What if a cleaning woman suspected of a murder she got
away with (her husband) fell under suspicion for a murder
she did not commit (her employer)? (Dolores Claiborne)
169

Stephen King

What if a young mother and her son became trapped in
their stalled car by a rabid dog? (Cujo)
These were all situations which occurred to me—while
showering, while driving, while taking my daily walk—and
which I eventually turned into books. In no case were they
plotted, not even to the extent of a single note jotted on a single piece of scrap paper, although some of the stories (Dolores
Claiborne, for instance) are almost as complex as those you find
in murder mysteries. Please remember, however, that there is
a huge difference between story and plot. Story is honorable
and trustworthy; plot is shifty, and best kept under house
arrest.
Each of the novels summarized above was smoothed out
and detailed by the editorial process, of course, but most of
the elements existed to begin with. “A movie should be there
in rough cut,” the film editor Paul Hirsch once told me. The
same is true of books. I think it’s rare that incoherence or dull
storytelling can be solved by something so minor as a second
draft.
This isn’t a textbook, and so there aren’t a lot of exercises,
but I want to offer you one now, in case you feel that all this
talk about situation replacing plot is so much woolly-headed
bullshit. I am going to show you the location of a fossil. Your
job is to write five or six pages of unplotted narration concerning this fossil. Put another way, I want you to dig for the
bones and see what they look like. I think you may be quite
surprised and delighted with the results. Ready? Here we go.
Everyone is familiar with the basic details of the following
story; with small variations, it seems to pop up in the Police
Beat section of metropolitan daily papers every other week or
so. A woman—call her Jane—marries a man who is bright,
witty, and pulsing with sexual magnetism. We’ll call the guy
170

On Writing

Dick; it’s the world’s most Freudian name. Unfortunately,
Dick has a dark side. He’s short-tempered, a control freak,
perhaps even (you’ll find this out as he speaks and acts) a paranoid. Jane tries mightily to overlook Dick’s faults and make
the marriage work (why she tries so hard is something you
will also find out; she will come onstage and tell you). They
have a child, and for awhile things seem better. Then, when
the little girl is three or so, the abuse and the jealous tirades
begin again. The abuse is verbal at first, then physical. Dick
is convinced that Jane is sleeping with someone, perhaps
someone from her job. Is it someone specific? I don’t know
and don’t care. Eventually Dick may tell you who he suspects.
If he does, we’ll both know, won’t we?
At last poor Jane can’t take it anymore. She divorces the
schmuck and gets custody of their daughter, Little Nell.
Dick begins to stalk her. Jane responds by getting a restraining order, a document about as useful as a parasol in a hurricane, as many abused women will tell you. Finally, after an
incident which you will write in vivid and scary detail—a
public beating, perhaps—Richard the Schmuck is arrested
and jailed. All of this is back story. How you work it in—and
how much of it you work in—is up to you. In any case, it’s not
the situation. What follows is the situation.
One day shortly after Dick’s incarceration in the city jail,
Jane picks up Little Nell at the daycare center and ferries her
to a friend’s house for a birthday party. Jane then takes herself home, looking forward to two or three hours’ unaccustomed peace and quiet. Perhaps, she thinks, I’ll take a nap.
It’s a house she’s going to, even though she’s a young working woman—the situation sort of demands it. How she came
by this house and why she has the afternoon off are things
the story will tell you and which will look neatly plotted if
171

Stephen King

you come up with good reasons (perhaps the house belongs
to her parents; perhaps she’s house-sitting; perhaps another
thing entirely).
Something pings at her, just below the level of consciousness, as she lets herself in, something that makes her uneasy.
She can’t isolate it and tells herself it’s just nerves, a little fallout from her five years of hell with Mr. Congeniality. What
else could it be? Dick is under lock and key, after all.
Before taking her nap, Jane decides to have a cup of herbal
tea and watch the news. (Can you use that pot of boiling
water on the stove later on? Perhaps, perhaps.) The lead item
on Action News at Three is a shocker: that morning, three
men escaped from the city jail, killing a guard in the process.
Two of the three bad guys were recaptured almost at once, but
the third is still at large. None of the prisoners are identified
by name (not in this newscast, at least), but Jane, sitting in her
empty house (which you will now have plausibly explained),
knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that one of them was
Dick. She knows because she has finally identified that ping of
unease she felt in the foyer. It was the smell, faint and fading,
of Vitalis hair-tonic. Dick’s hair-tonic. Jane sits in her chair, her
muscles lax with fright, unable to get up. And as she hears
Dick’s footfalls begin to descend the stairs, she thinks: Only
Dick would make sure he had hair-tonic, even in jail. She must get
up, must run, but she can’t move . . .
It’s a pretty good story, yes? I think so, but not exactly
unique. As I’ve already pointed out, ESTRANGED HUBBY BEATS UP
(or MURDERS) EX-WIFE makes the paper every other week, sad
but true. What I want you to do in this exercise is change the
sexes of the antagonist and protagonist before beginning to work
out the situation in your narrative—make the ex-wife the
stalker, in other words (perhaps it’s a mental institution she’s
172

On Writing

escaped from instead of the city jail), the husband the victim.
Narrate this without plotting—let the situation and that
one unexpected inversion carry you along. I predict you will
succeed swimmingly . . . if, that is, you are honest about
how your characters speak and behave. Honesty in storytelling makes up for a great many stylistic faults, as the work
of wooden-prose writers like Theodore Dreiser and Ayn Rand
shows, but lying is the great unrepairable fault. Liars prosper,
no question about it, but only in the grand sweep of things,
never down in the jungles of actual composition, where you
must take your objective one bloody word at a time. If you
begin to lie about what you know and feel while you’re down
there, everything falls down.
When you finish your exercise, drop me a line at
www.stephenking.com and tell me how it worked for you. I
can’t promise to vet every reply, but I can promise to read at
least some of your adventures with great interest. I’m curious
to know what kind of fossil you dig up, and how much of it
you are able to retrieve from the ground intact.

Description is what makes the reader a sensory participant in
the story. Good description is a learned skill, one of the prime
reasons why you cannot succeed unless you read a lot and
write a lot. It’s not just a question of how-to, you see; it’s also
a question of how much to. Reading will help you answer how
much, and only reams of writing will help you with the how.
You can learn only by doing.
Description begins with visualization of what it is you
want the reader to experience. It ends with your translating
173

Stephen King

what you see in your mind into words on the page. It’s far
from easy. As I’ve said, we’ve all heard someone say, “Man, it
was so great (or so horrible/strange/funny) . . . I just can’t
describe it!” If you want to be a successful writer, you must be
able to describe it, and in a way that will cause your reader to
prickle with recognition. If you can do this, you will be paid
for your labors, and deservedly so. If you can’t, you’re going
to collect a lot of rejection slips and perhaps explore a career
in the fascinating world of telemarketing.
Thin description leaves the reader feeling bewildered and
nearsighted. Overdescription buries him or her in details and
images. The trick is to find a happy medium. It’s also important to know what to describe and what can be left alone
while you get on with your main job, which is telling a story.
I’m not particularly keen on writing which exhaustively
describes the physical characteristics of the people in the
story and what they’re wearing (I find wardrobe inventory
particularly irritating; if I want to read descriptions of clothes,
I can always get a J. Crew catalogue). I can’t remember many
cases where I felt I had to describe what the people in a story
of mine looked like—I’d rather let the reader supply the
faces, the builds, and the clothing as well. If I tell you that
Carrie White is a high school outcast with a bad complexion
and a fashion-victim wardrobe, I think you can do the rest,
can’t you? I don’t need to give you a pimple-by-pimple,
skirt-by-skirt rundown. We all remember one or more high
school losers, after all; if I describe mine, it freezes out yours,
and I lose a little bit of the bond of understanding I want to
forge between us. Description begins in the writer’s imagination, but should finish in the reader’s. When it comes to
actually pulling this off, the writer is much more fortunate
than the filmmaker, who is almost always doomed to show
174

On Writing

too much . . . including, in nine cases out of ten, the zipper
running up the monster’s back.
I think locale and texture are much more important to the
reader’s sense of actually being in the story than any physical
description of the players. Nor do I think that physical description should be a shortcut to character. So spare me, if you
please, the hero’s sharply intelligent blue eyes and outthrust
determined chin; likewise the heroine’s arrogant cheekbones. This sort of thing is bad technique and lazy writing, the
equivalent of all those tiresome adverbs.
For me, good description usually consists of a few wellchosen details that will stand for everything else. In most
cases, these details will be the first ones that come to mind.
Certainly they will do for a start. If you decide later on that
you’d like to change, add, or delete, you can do so—it’s what
rewrite was invented for. But I think you will find that, in
most cases, your first visualized details will be the truest and
best. You should remember (and your reading will prove it
over and over again should you begin to doubt) that it’s as
easy to overdescribe as to underdescribe. Probably easier.
One of my favorite restaurants in New York is the steakhouse Palm Too on Second Avenue. If I decide to set a scene in
Palm Too, I’ll certainly be writing about what I know, as I’ve
been there on a number of occasions. Before beginning to
write, I’ll take a moment to call up an image of the place,
drawing from my memory and filling my mind’s eye, an eye
whose vision grows sharper the more it is used. I call it a mental eye because that’s the phrase with which we’re all familiar,
but what I actually want to do is open all my senses. This
memory search will be brief but intense, a kind of hypnotic
recall. And, as with actual hypnosis, you’ll find it easier to
accomplish the more you attempt it.
175

Stephen King

The first four things which come to my mind when I think
of Palm Too are: (a) the darkness of the bar and the contrasting brightness of the backbar mirror, which catches and
reflects light from the street; (b) the sawdust on the floor; (c)
the funky cartoon caricatures on the walls; (d) the smells of
cooking steak and fish.
If I think longer I can come up with more stuff (what I
don’t remember I’ll make up—during the visualization
process, fact and fiction become entwined), but there’s no
need for more. This isn’t the Taj Mahal we’re visiting, after
all, and I don’t want to sell you the place. It’s also important
to remember it’s not about the setting, anyway—it’s about
the story, and it’s always about the story. It will not behoove
me (or you) to wander off into thickets of description just
because it would be easy to do. We have other fish (and
steak) to fry.
Bearing that in mind, here’s a sample bit of narration
which takes a character into Palm Too:
The cab pulled up in front of Palm Too at quarter to
four on a bright summer afternoon. Billy paid the
driver, stepped out onto the sidewalk, and took a quick
look around for Martin. Not in sight. Satisfied, Billy
went inside.
After the hot clarity of Second Avenue, Palm Too was
as dark as a cave. The backbar mirror picked up some
of the street-glare and glimmered in the gloom like a
mirage. For a moment it was all Billy could see, and
then his eyes began to adjust. There were a few solitary
drinkers at the bar. Beyond them, the maître d’, his tie
undone and his shirt cuffs rolled back to show his hairy
wrists, was talking with the bartender. There was still
176

On Writing
sawdust sprinkled on the floor, Billy noted, as if this
were a twenties speakeasy instead of a millennium
eatery where you couldn’t smoke, let alone spit a gob of
tobacco between your feet. And the cartoons dancing
across the walls—gossip-column caricatures of downtown political hustlers, newsmen who had long since
retired or drunk themselves to death, celebrities you
couldn’t quite recognize—still gambolled all the way to
the ceiling. The air was redolent of steak and fried
onions. All of it the same as it ever was.
The maître d’ stepped forward. “Can I help you, sir?
We don’t open for dinner until six, but the bar—”
“I’m looking for Richie Martin,” Billy said.

Billy’s arrival in the cab is narration—action, if you like
that word better. What follows after he steps through the
door of the restaurant is pretty much straight description. I
got in almost all of the details which first came to mind
when I accessed my memories of the real Palm Too, and I
added a few other things, as well—the maître d’ between
shifts is pretty good, I think; I love the undone tie and the
cuffs rolled up to expose the hairy wrists. It’s like a photograph. The smell of fish is the only thing not here, and that’s
because the smell of the onions was stronger.
We come back to actual storytelling with a bit of narration
(the maître d’ steps forward to center stage) and then the dialogue. By now we see our location clearly. There are plenty of
details I could have added—the narrowness of the room,
Tony Bennett on the sound system, the Yankees bumpersticker on the cash register—but what would be the point?
When it comes to scene-setting and all sorts of description, a
meal is as good as a feast. We want to know if Billy has
177

Stephen King

located Richie Martin—that’s the story we paid our twentyfour bucks to read. More about the restaurant would slow the
pace of that story, perhaps annoying us enough to break the
spell good fiction can weave. In many cases when a reader
puts a story aside because it “got boring,” the boredom arose
because the writer grew enchanted with his powers of description and lost sight of his priority, which is to keep the ball
rolling. If the reader wants to know more about Palm Too
than can be found above, he or she can either visit the next
time he or she is in New York, or send for a brochure. I’ve
already spilled enough ink here for me to indicate Palm Too
will be a major setting for my story. If it turns out not to be,
I’d do well to revise the descriptive stuff down by a few lines
in the next draft. Certainly I couldn’t keep it in on the
grounds that it’s good; it should be good, if I’m being paid to
do it. What I’m not being paid to do is be self-indulgent.
There is straight description (“a few solitary drinkers at
the bar”) and a bit of rather more poetic description (“The
backbar mirror . . . glimmered in the gloom like a mirage”)
in my central descriptive paragraph about Palm Too. Both
are okay, but I like the figurative stuff. The use of simile and
other figurative language is one of the chief delights of fiction—reading it and writing it, as well. When it’s on target,
a simile delights us in much the same way meeting an old
friend in a crowd of strangers does. By comparing two seemingly unrelated objects—a restaurant bar and a cave, a mirror and a mirage—we are sometimes able to see an old thing
in a new and vivid way.* Even if the result is mere clarity
*Although “dark as a cave” isn’t all that riveting; certainly we’ve heard it
before. It is, truth to tell, a bit lazy, not quite a cliché but certainly in the
neighborhood.
178

On Writing

instead of beauty, I think writer and reader are participating
together in a kind of miracle. Maybe that’s drawing it a little
strong, but yeah—it’s what I believe.
When a simile or metaphor doesn’t work, the results are
sometimes funny and sometimes embarrassing. Recently I
read this sentence in a forthcoming novel I prefer not to
name: “He sat stolidly beside the corpse, waiting for the
medical examiner as patiently as a man waiting for a turkey
sandwich.” If there is a clarifying connection here, I wasn’t
able to make it. I consequently closed the book without reading further. If a writer knows what he or she is doing, I’ll go
along for the ride. If he or she doesn’t . . . well, I’m in my
fifties now, and there are a lot of books out there. I don’t have
time to waste with the poorly written ones.
The Zen simile is only one potential pitfall of figurative
language. The most common—and again, landing in this
trap can usually be traced back to not enough reading—is
the use of clichéd similes, metaphors, and images. He ran
like a madman, she was pretty as a summer day, the guy
was a hot ticket, Bob fought like a tiger . . . don’t waste my
time (or anyone’s) with such chestnuts. It makes you look
either lazy or ignorant. Neither description will do your reputation as a writer much good.
My all-time favorite similes, by the way, come from the
hardboiled-detective fiction of the forties and fifties, and the
literary descendants of the dime-dreadful writers. These
favorites include “It was darker than a carload of assholes”
(George V. Higgins) and “I lit a cigarette [that] tasted like a
plumber’s handkerchief ” (Raymond Chandler).
The key to good description begins with clear seeing and
ends with clear writing, the kind of writing that employs
fresh images and simple vocabulary. I began learning my
179

Stephen King

lessons in this regard by reading Chandler, Hammett, and
Ross MacDonald; I gained perhaps even more respect for
the power of compact, descriptive language from reading T. S.
Eliot (those ragged claws scuttling across the ocean floor;
those coffee spoons), and William Carlos Williams (white
chickens, red wheelbarrow, the plums that were in the ice box,
so sweet and so cold).
As with all other aspects of the narrative art, you will
improve with practice, but practice will never make you perfect. Why should it? What fun would that be? And the
harder you try to be clear and simple, the more you will learn
about the complexity of our American dialect. It be slippery,
precious; aye, it be very slippery, indeed. Practice the art,
always reminding yourself that your job is to say what you
see, and then to get on with your story.

–7–
Let us now talk a little bit about dialogue, the audio portion
of our programme. It’s dialogue that gives your cast their
voices, and is crucial in defining their characters—only what
people do tells us more about what they’re like, and talk is
sneaky: what people say often conveys their character to others in ways of which they—the speakers—are completely
unaware.
You can tell me via straight narration that your main character, Mistuh Butts, never did well in school, never even went
much to school, but you can convey the same thing, and
much more vividly, by his speech . . . and one of the cardinal
rules of good fiction is never tell us a thing if you can show
us, instead:
180

On Writing
“What you reckon?” the boy asked. He doodled a stick in
the dirt without looking up. What he drew could have
been a ball, or a planet, or nothing but a circle. “You
reckon the earth goes around the sun like they say?”
“I don’t know what they say,” Mistuh Butts replied.
“I ain’t never studied what thisun or thatun says,
because eachun says a different thing until your head is
finally achin and you lose your aminite.”
“What’s aminite?” the boy asked.
“You don’t never shut up the questions!” Mistuh
Butts cried. He seized the boy’s stick and snapped it.
“Aminite is in your belly when it’s time to eat! Less you
sick! And folks say I’m ignorant!”
“Oh, appetite,” the boy said placidly, and began drawing again, this time with his finger.

Well-crafted dialogue will indicate if a character is smart
or dumb (Mistuh Butts isn’t necessarily a moron just because
he can’t say appetite; we must listen to him awhile longer
before making up our minds on that score), honest or dishonest, amusing or an old sobersides. Good dialogue, such as
that written by George V. Higgins, Peter Straub, or Graham
Greene, is a delight to read; bad dialogue is deadly.
Writers have different skill levels when it comes to dialogue. Your skills in this area can be improved, but, as a
great man once said (actually it was Clint Eastwood), “A
man’s got to know his limitations.” H. P. Lovecraft was a
genius when it came to tales of the macabre, but a terrible
dialogue writer. He seems to have known it, too, because in
the millions of words of fiction he wrote, fewer than five thousand are dialogue. The following passage from “The Colour
Out of Space,” in which a dying farmer describes the alien
181

Stephen King

presence which has invaded his well, showcases Lovecraft’s
dialogue problems. Folks, people just don’t talk like this,
even on their deathbeds:
“Nothin’ . . . nothin’ . . . the colour . . . it burns . . . cold
an’ wet . . . but it burns . . . it lived in the well . . . I seen
it . . . a kind o’ smoke . . . jest like the flowers last spring
. . . the well shone at night . . . everything alive . . .
sucked the life out of everything . . . in the stone . . . it
must a’come in that stone . . . pizened the whole place
. . . dun’t know what it wants . . . that round thing the
men from the college dug out’n the stone . . . it was that
same colour . . . jest the same, like the flowers an’ plants
. . . seeds . . . I seen it the fust time this week . . . it beats
down your mind an’ then gets ye . . . burns ye up . . . It
come from some place whar things ain’t as they is here
. . . one o’ them professors said so . . .”

And so on and so forth, in carefully constructed elliptical
bursts of information. It’s hard to say exactly what’s wrong
with Lovecraft’s dialogue, other than the obvious: it’s stilted
and lifeless, brimming with country cornpone (“some place
whar things ain’t as they is here”). When dialogue is right,
we know. When it’s wrong we also know—it jags on the ear
like a badly tuned musical instrument.
Lovecraft was, by all accounts, both snobbish and
painfully shy (a galloping racist as well, his stories full of sinister Africans and the sort of scheming Jews my Uncle Oren
always worried about after four or five beers), the kind of
writer who maintains a voluminous correspondence but gets
along poorly with others in person—were he alive today,
he’d likely exist most vibrantly in various Internet chat182

On Writing

rooms. Dialogue is a skill best learned by people who enjoy
talking and listening to others—particularly listening, picking up the accents, rhythms, dialect, and slang of various
groups. Loners such as Lovecraft often write it badly, or with
the care of someone who is composing in a language other
than his or her native tongue.
I don’t know if contemporary novelist John Katzenbach is
a loner or not, but his novel Hart’s War contains some memorably bad dialogue. Katzenbach is the sort of novelist who
drives creative-writing teachers mad, a wonderful storyteller
whose art is marred by self-repetition (a fault which is curable) and an ear for talk that is pure tin (a fault which probably isn’t). Hart’s War is a murder mystery set in a World War
II POW camp—a neat idea, but problematic in Katzenbach’s hands once he really gets the pot boiling. Here is
Wing Commander Phillip Pryce talking to his friends just
before the Germans in charge of Stalag Luft 13 take him
away, not to be repatriated as they claim, but probably to be
shot in the woods.
Pryce grabbed at Tommy once again. “Tommy,” he
whispered, “this is not a coincidence! Nothing is what it
seems! Dig deeper! Save him, lad, save him! For more
than ever, now, I believe Scott is innocent! . . . You’re on
your own now, boys. And remember, I’m counting on
you to live through this! Survive! Whatever happens!”
He turned back to the Germans. “All right, Hauptmann,” he said with a sudden, exceedingly calm determination. “I’m ready now. Do with me what you will.”

Either Katzenbach does not realize that every line of the
Wing Commander’s dialogue is a cliché from a late-forties
183

Stephen King

war movie or he’s trying to use that similarity deliberately to
awaken feelings of pity, sadness, and perhaps nostalgia in his
audience. Either way, it doesn’t work. The only feeling the
passage evokes is a kind of impatient incredulity. You wonder
if any editor ever saw it, and if so, what stayed his or her blue
pencil. Given Katzenbach’s considerable talents in other
areas, his failure here tends to reinforce my idea that writing
good dialogue is art as well as craft.
Many good dialogue writers simply seem to have been
born with a well-tuned ear, just as some musicians and
singers have perfect or near-perfect pitch. Here’s a passage
from Elmore Leonard’s novel Be Cool. You might compare it
to the Lovecraft and Katzenbach passages above, noting first
of all that here we’ve got an honest-to-God exchange going
on, and not a stilted soliloquy:
Chili . . . looked up again as Tommy said, “You doing
okay?”
“You want to know if I’m making out?”
“I mean in your business. How’s it going? I know you
did okay with Get Leo, a terrific picture, terrific. And
you know what else? It was good. But the sequel—what
was it called?”
“Get Lost.”
“Yeah, well that’s what happened before I got a
chance to see it, it disappeared.”
“It didn’t open big so the studio walked away. I was
against doing a sequel to begin with. But the guy running production at Tower says they’re making the picture, with me or without me. I thought, well, if I can
come up with a good story . . .”

184

On Writing

Two guys at lunch in Beverly Hills, and right away we
know they’re both players. They may be phonies (and maybe
they’re not), but they’re an instant buy within the context of
Leonard’s story; in fact, we welcome them with open arms.
Their talk is so real that part of what we feel is the guilty
pleasure of anyone first tuning in and then eavesdropping on
an interesting conversation. We’re getting a sense of character, as well, although only in faint strokes. This is early on in
the novel (page two, actually), and Leonard is an old pro. He
knows he doesn’t have to do it all at once. Still, don’t we
learn something about Tommy’s character when he assures
Chili that Get Leo is not only terrific, but also good?
We could ask ourselves if such dialogue is true to life or
only to a certain idea of life, a certain stereotyped image of
Hollywood players, Hollywood lunches, Hollywood deals.
This is a fair enough question, and the answer is, perhaps
not. Yet the dialogue does ring true to our ear; at his best (and
although Be Cool is quite entertaining, it is far from Leonard’s
best), Elmore Leonard is capable of a kind of street poetry.
The skill necessary to write such dialogue comes from years
of practice; the art comes from a creative imagination which
is working hard and having fun.
As with all other aspects of fiction, the key to writing good
dialogue is honesty. And if you are honest about the words
coming out of your characters’ mouths, you’ll find that
you’ve let yourself in for a fair amount of criticism. Not a
week goes by that I don’t receive at least one pissed-off letter
(most weeks there are more) accusing me of being foulmouthed, bigoted, homophobic, murderous, frivolous, or
downright psychopathic. In the majority of cases what my
correspondents are hot under the collar about relates to

185

Stephen King

something in the dialogue: “Let’s get the fuck out of Dodge”
or “We don’t cotton much to niggers around here” or “What
do you think you’re doing, you fucking faggot?”
My mother, God rest her, didn’t approve of profanity or
any such talk; she called it “the language of the ignorant.”
This did not, however, keep her from yelling “Oh shit!” if
she burned the roast or nailed her thumb a good one while
hammering a picture-hook in the wall. Nor does it preclude
most people, Christian as well as heathen, from saying something similar (or even stronger) when the dog barfs on the
shag carpet or the car slips off the jack. It’s important to tell
the truth; so much depends upon it, as William Carlos
Williams almost said when he was writing about that red
wheelbarrow. The Legion of Decency might not like the
word shit, and you might not like it much, either, but sometimes you’re just stuck with it—no kid ever ran to his
mother and said that his little sister just defecated in the tub.
I suppose he might say pushed or went woowoo, but took a shit
is, I fear, very much in the ballpark (little pitchers have big
ears, after all).
You must tell the truth if your dialogue is to have the resonance and realism that Hart’s War, good story though it is, so
sadly lacks—and that holds true all the way down to what
folks say when they hit their thumb with the hammer. If you
substitute “Oh sugar!” for “Oh shit!” because you’re thinking about the Legion of Decency, you are breaking the
unspoken contract that exists between writer and reader—
your promise to express the truth of how people act and talk
through the medium of a made-up story.
On the other hand, one of your characters (the protagonist’s old maid aunt, for instance) really might say Oh sugar
instead of Oh shit after pounding her thumb with the hammer.
186

On Writing

You’ll know which to use if you know your character, and
we’ll learn something about the speaker that will make him or
her more vivid and interesting. The point is to let each character speak freely, without regard to what the Legion of
Decency or the Christian Ladies’ Reading Circle may approve
of. To do otherwise would be cowardly as well as dishonest,
and believe me, writing fiction in America as we enter the
twenty-first century is no job for intellectual cowards. There
are lots of would-be censors out there, and although they may
have different agendas, they all want basically the same thing:
for you to see the world they see . . . or to at least shut up
about what you do see that’s different. They are agents of the
status quo. Not necessarily bad guys, but dangerous guys if
you happen to believe in intellectual freedom.
As it happens, I agree with my mother: profanity and vulgarity is the language of the ignorant and the verbally challenged. Mostly, that is; there are exceptions, including profane
aphorisms of great color and vitality. They always fuck you at the
drive-thru; I’m busier than a one-legged man in an ass-kicking
contest; wish in one hand, shit in the other, see which one fills up
first—these phrases and others like them aren’t for the drawing-room, but they are striking and pungent. Or consider this
passage from Brain Storm, by Richard Dooling, where vulgarity becomes poetry:
“Exhibit A: One loutish, headstrong penis, a barbarous
cuntivore without a flyspeck of decency in him. The
capscallion of all rapscallions. A scurvy, vermiform scug
with a serpentine twinkle in his solitary eye. An orgulous Turk who strikes in the dark vaults of flesh like a
penile thunderbolt. A greedy cur seeking shadows,
slick crevices, tuna fish ecstasy, and sleep . . .”
187

Stephen King

Although not offered as dialogue, I want to reproduce
another passage from Dooling here, because it speaks to the
converse: that one can be quite admirably graphic without
resorting to vulgarity or profanity at all:
She straddled him and prepared to make the necessary
port connections, male and female adapters ready, I/O
enabled, server/client, master/slave. Just a couple of
high-end biological machines preparing to hot-dock
with cable modems and access each other’s front-end
processors.

If I were a Henry James or Jane Austen sort of guy, writing only about toffs or smart college folks, I’d hardly ever
have to use a dirty word or a profane phrase; I might never
have had a book banned from America’s school libraries or
gotten a letter from some helpful fundamentalist fellow who
wants me to know that I’m going to burn in hell, where all
my millions of dollars won’t buy me so much as a single
drink of water. I did not, however, grow up among folks of
that sort. I grew up as a part of America’s lower middle class,
and they’re the people I can write about with the most honesty and knowledge. It means that they say shit more often
than sugar when they bang their thumbs, but I’ve made my
peace with that. Was never much at war with it in the first
place, as a matter of fact.
When I get one of Those Letters, or face another review
that accuses me of being a vulgar lowbrow—which to some
extent I am—I take comfort from the words of turn-of-thecentury social realist Frank Norris, whose novels include The
Octopus, The Pit, and McTeague, an authentically great book.
Norris wrote about working-class guys on ranches, in city
188

On Writing

laboring jobs, in factories. McTeague, the main character of
Norris’s finest work, is an unschooled dentist. Norris’s books
provoked a good deal of public outrage, to which Norris
responded coolly and disdainfully: “What do I care for their
opinions? I never truckled. I told them the truth.”
Some people don’t want to hear the truth, of course, but
that’s not your problem. What would be is wanting to be a
writer without wanting to shoot straight. Talk, whether ugly
or beautiful, is an index of character; it can also be a breath of
cool, refreshing air in a room some people would prefer to keep
shut up. In the end, the important question has nothing to do
with whether the talk in your story is sacred or profane; the
only question is how it rings on the page and in the ear. If you
expect it to ring true, then you must talk yourself. Even more
important, you must shut up and listen to others talk.

–8–
Everything I’ve said about dialogue applies to building characters in fiction. The job boils down to two things: paying
attention to how the real people around you behave and then
telling the truth about what you see. You may notice that
your next-door neighbor picks his nose when he thinks no
one is looking. This is a great detail, but noting it does you
no good as a writer unless you’re willing to dump it into a
story at some point.
Are fictional characters drawn directly from life? Obviously not, at least on a one-to-one basis—you’d better not,
unless you want to get sued or shot on your way to the mailbox some fine morning. In many cases, such as roman à clef novels like Valley of the Dolls, characters are drawn mostly from life,
189

Stephen King

but after readers get done playing the inevitable guessing game
about who’s who, these stories tend to be unsatisfying, stuffed
with shadowbox celebrities who bonk each other and then fade
quickly from the reader’s mind. I read Valley of the Dolls shortly
after it came out (I was a cook’s boy at a western Maine
resort that summer), gobbling it up as eagerly as everyone else
who bought it, I suppose, but I can’t remember much of
what it was about. On the whole, I think I prefer the weekly
codswallop served up by The National Enquirer, where I can get
recipes and cheesecake photographs as well as scandal.
For me, what happens to characters as a story progresses
depends solely on what I discover about them as I go along—
how they grow, in other words. Sometimes they grow a little.
If they grow a lot, they begin to influence the course of the
story instead of the other way around. I almost always start
with something that’s situational. I don’t say that’s right, only
that it’s the way I’ve always worked. If a story ends up that
same way, however, I count it something of a failure no matter how interesting it may be to me or to others. I think the
best stories always end up being about the people rather
than the event, which is to say character-driven. Once you get
beyond the short story, though (two to four thousand words,
let’s say), I’m not much of a believer in the so-called character study; I think that in the end, the story should always be
the boss. Hey, if you want a character study, buy a biography
or get season tickets to your local college’s theater-lab productions. You’ll get all the character you can stand.
It’s also important to remember that no one is “the bad
guy” or “the best friend” or “the whore with a heart of gold”
in real life; in real life we each of us regard ourselves as the
main character, the protagonist, the big cheese; the camera is
on us, baby. If you can bring this attitude into your fiction,
190

On Writing

you may not find it easier to create brilliant characters, but it
will be harder for you to create the sort of one-dimensional
dopes that populate so much pop fiction.
Annie Wilkes, the nurse who holds Paul Sheldon prisoner in
Misery, may seem psychopathic to us, but it’s important to
remember that she seems perfectly sane and reasonable to herself—heroic, in fact, a beleaguered woman trying to survive in
a hostile world filled with cockadoodie brats. We see her go
through dangerous mood-swings, but I tried never to come
right out and say “Annie was depressed and possibly suicidal
that day” or “Annie seemed particularly happy that day.” If I
have to tell you, I lose. If, on the other hand, I can show you
a silent, dirty-haired woman who compulsively gobbles cake
and candy, then have you draw the conclusion that Annie is in
the depressive part of a manic-depressive cycle, I win. And if
I am able, even briefly, to give you a Wilkes’-eye-view of the
world—if I can make you understand her madness—then perhaps I can make her someone you sympathize with or even
identify with. The result? She’s more frightening than ever,
because she’s close to real. If, on the other hand, I turn her into
a cackling old crone, she’s just another pop-up bogeylady. In
that case I lose bigtime, and so does the reader. Who would
want to visit with such a stale shrew? That version of Annie
was old when The Wizard of Oz was in its first run.
It would be fair enough to ask, I suppose, if Paul Sheldon in
Misery is me. Certainly parts of him are . . . but I think you will
find that, if you continue to write fiction, every character
you create is partly you. When you ask yourself what a certain
character will do given a certain set of circumstances, you’re
making the decision based on what you yourself would (or, in
the case of a bad guy, wouldn’t) do. Added to these versions of
yourself are the character traits, both lovely and unlovely,
191

Stephen King

which you observe in others (a guy who picks his nose when
he thinks no one is looking, for instance). There is also a
wonderful third element: pure blue-sky imagination. This is
the part which allowed me to be a psychotic nurse for a little
while when I was writing Misery. And being Annie was not,
by and large, hard at all. In fact, it was sort of fun. I think
being Paul was harder. He was sane, I’m sane, no four days at
Disneyland there.
My novel The Dead Zone arose from two questions: Can a
political assassin ever be right? And if he is, could you make
him the protagonist of a novel? The good guy? These ideas
called for a dangerously unstable politician, it seemed to
me—a fellow who could climb the political ladder by showing the world a jolly, jes’-folks face and charming the voters by
refusing to play the game in the usual way. (Greg Stillson’s
campaign tactics as I imagined them twenty years ago were
very similar to the ones Jesse Ventura used in his successful
campaign for the governor’s seat in Minnesota. Thank goodness Ventura doesn’t seem like Stillson in any other ways.)
The Dead Zone’s protagonist, Johnny Smith, is also an
everyday, jes’-folks sort of guy, only with Johnny it’s no act.
The one thing that sets him apart is a limited ability to see the
future, gained as the result of a childhood accident. When
Johnny shakes Greg Stillson’s hand at a political rally, he has
a vision of Stillson becoming the President of the United
States and subsequently starting World War III. Johnny
comes to the conclusion that the only way he can keep this
from happening—the only way he can save the world, in
other words—is by putting a bullet in Stillson’s head. Johnny
is different from other violent, paranoid mystics in only one
way: he really can see the future. Only don’t they all say
that?
192

On Writing

The situation had an edgy, outlaw feel to it that appealed to
me. I thought the story would work if I could make Johnny a
genuinely decent guy without turning him into a plaster
saint. Same thing with Stillson, only backwards: I wanted him
to be authentically nasty and really scare the reader, not just
because Stillson is always boiling with potential violence but
because he is so goddam persuasive. I wanted the reader to constantly be thinking: “This guy is out of control—how come
somebody can’t see through him?” The fact that Johnny does
see through him would, I thought, put the reader even more
firmly in Johnny’s corner.
When we first meet the potential assassin, he’s taking his
girl to the county fair, riding the rides and playing the games.
What could be more normal or likable? The fact that he’s on
the verge of proposing to Sarah makes us like him even more.
Later, when Sarah suggests they cap a perfect date by sleeping
together for the first time, Johnny tells her he wants to wait
until they’re married. I felt I was walking a fine line on that
one—I wanted readers to see Johnny as sincere and sincerely
in love, a straight shooter but not a tight-assed prude. I was
able to cut his principled behavior a bit by giving him a
childish sense of humor; he greets Sarah wearing a glow-inthe-dark Halloween mask (the mask hopefully works in a
symbolic way, too; certainly Johnny is perceived as a monster
when he points a gun at candidate Stillson). “Same old
Johnny,” Sarah says, laughing, and by the time the two of
them are headed back from the fair in Johnny’s old Volkswagen Bug, I think Johnny Smith has become our friend, just an
average American guy who’s hoping to live happily ever after.
The sort of guy who’d return your wallet with the money still
in it if he found it on the street or stop and help you change
your flat tire if he came upon you broke down by the side of
193

Stephen King

the road. Ever since John F. Kennedy was shot in Dallas, the
great American bogeyman has been the guy with the rifle in
a high place. I wanted to make this guy into the reader’s
friend.
Johnny was hard. Taking an average guy and making him
vivid and interesting always is. Greg Stillson (like most villains) was easier and a lot more fun. I wanted to nail his dangerous, divided character in the first scene of the book. Here,
several years before he runs for the U.S. House of Representatives in New Hampshire, Stillson is a young travelling
salesman hawking Bibles to midwest country folk. When he
stops at one farm, he is menaced by a snarling dog. Stillson
remains friendly and smiling—Mr. Jes’ Folks—until he’s
positive no one’s home at the farm. Then he sprays teargas
into the dog’s eyes and kicks it to death.
If one is to measure success by reader response, the opening
scene of The Dead Zone (my first number-one hardcover bestseller) was one of my most successful ever. Certainly it struck
a raw nerve; I was deluged with letters, most of them protesting my outrageous cruelty to animals. I wrote back to these
folks, pointing out the usual things: (a) Greg Stillson wasn’t
real; (b) the dog wasn’t real; (c) I myself had never in my life
put the boot to one of my pets, or anyone else’s. I also pointed
out what might have been a little less obvious—it was important to establish, right up front, that Gregory Ammas Stillson
was an extremely dangerous man, and very good at camouflage.
I continued to build the characters of Johnny and Greg in
alternating scenes until the confrontation at the end of the
book, when things resolve themselves in what I hoped would
be an unexpected way. The characters of my protagonist and
antagonist were determined by the story I had to tell—by the
194

On Writing

fossil, the found object, in other words. My job (and yours, if
you decide this is a viable approach to storytelling) is to make
sure these fictional folks behave in ways that will both help
the story and seem reasonable to us, given what we know
about them (and what we know about real life, of course).
Sometimes villains feel self-doubt (as Greg Stillson does);
sometimes they feel pity (as Annie Wilkes does). And sometimes the good guy tries to turn away from doing the right
thing, as Johnny Smith does . . . as Jesus Christ himself did, if
you think about that prayer (“take this cup from my lips”) in
the Garden of Gethsemane. And if you do your job, your
characters will come to life and start doing stuff on their
own. I know that sounds a little creepy if you haven’t actually
experienced it, but it’s terrific fun when it happens. And it will
solve a lot of your problems, believe me.

–9–
We’ve covered some basic aspects of good storytelling, all of
which return to the same core ideas: that practice is invaluable (and should feel good, really not like practice at all) and
that honesty is indispensable. Skills in description, dialogue,
and character development all boil down to seeing or hearing
clearly and then transcribing what you see or hear with equal
clarity (and without using a lot of tiresome, unnecessary
adverbs).
There are lots of bells and whistles, too—onomatopoeia,
incremental repetition, stream of consciousness, interior dialogue, changes of verbal tense (it has become quite fashionable
to tell stories, especially shorter ones, in the present tense), the
sticky question of back story (how do you get it in and how
195

Stephen King

much of it belongs), theme, pacing (we’ll touch on these last
two), and a dozen other topics, all of which are covered—
sometimes at exhausting length—in writing courses and
standard writing texts.
My take on all these things is pretty simple. It’s all on the
table, every bit of it, and you should use anything that
improves the quality of your writing and doesn’t get in the
way of your story. If you like an alliterative phrase—the
knights of nowhere battling the nabobs of nullity—by all
means throw it in and see how it looks on paper. If it seems to
work, it can stay. If it doesn’t (and to me this one sounds
pretty bad, like Spiro Agnew crossed with Robert Jordan),
well, that DELETE key is on your machine for a good reason.
There is absolutely no need to be hidebound and conservative in your work, just as you are under no obligation to
write experimental, nonlinear prose because The Village Voice
or The New York Review of Books says the novel is dead. Both
the traditional and the modern are available to you. Shit,
write upside down if you want to, or do it in Crayola pictographs. But no matter how you do it, there comes a point
when you must judge what you’ve written and how well you
wrote it. I don’t believe a story or a novel should be allowed
outside the door of your study or writing room unless you feel
confident that it’s reasonably reader-friendly. You can’t please
all of the readers all of the time; you can’t please even some of
the readers all of the time, but you really ought to try to
please at least some of the readers some of the time. I think
William Shakespeare said that. And now that I’ve waved
that caution flag, duly satisfying all OSHA, MENSA, NASA,
and Writers’ Guild guidelines, let me reiterate that it’s all on
the table, all up for grabs. Isn’t that an intoxicating thought?
I think it is. Try any goddam thing you like, no matter how
196

On Writing

boringly normal or outrageous. If it works, fine. If it doesn’t,
toss it. Toss it even if you love it. Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch
once said, “Murder your darlings,” and he was right.
I most often see chances to add the grace-notes and ornamental touches after my basic storytelling job is done. Once in
awhile it comes earlier; not long after I began The Green Mile
and realized my main character was an innocent man likely to
be executed for the crime of another, I decided to give him the
initials J.C., after the most famous innocent man of all time. I
first saw this done in Light in August (still my favorite Faulkner
novel), where the sacrificial lamb is named Joe Christmas. Thus
death-row inmate John Bowes became John Coffey. I wasn’t
sure, right up to the end of the book, if my J.C. would live or
die. I wanted him to live because I liked and pitied him, but I
figured those initials couldn’t hurt, one way or the other.*
Mostly I don’t see stuff like that until the story’s done.
Once it is, I’m able to kick back, read over what I’ve written,
and look for underlying patterns. If I see some (and I almost
always do), I can work at bringing them out in a second, more
fully realized, draft of the story. Two examples of the sort of
work second drafts were made for are symbolism and theme.
If in school you ever studied the symbolism of the color
white in Moby-Dick or Hawthorne’s symbolic use of the forest in such stories as “Young Goodman Brown” and came
away from those classes feeling like a stupidnik, you may
even now be backing off with your hands raised protectively
in front of you, shaking your head and saying gee, no thanks, I
gave at the office.
*A few critics accused me of being symbolically simplistic in the matter
of John Coffey’s initials. And I’m like, “What is this, rocket science?” I
mean, come on, guys.
197

Stephen King

But wait. Symbolism doesn’t have to be difficult and
relentlessly brainy. Nor does it have to be consciously crafted
as a kind of ornamental Turkish rug upon which the furniture
of the story stands. If you can go along with the concept of
the story as a pre-existing thing, a fossil in the ground, then
symbolism must also be pre-existing, right? Just another
bone (or set of them) in your new discovery. That’s if it’s
there. If it isn’t, so what? You’ve still got the story itself,
don’t you?
If it is there and if you notice it, I think you should bring it
out as well as you can, polishing it until it shines and then
cutting it the way a jeweler would cut a precious or semiprecious stone.
Carrie, as I’ve already noted, is a short novel about a
picked-on girl who discovers a telekinetic ability within herself—she can move objects by thinking about them. To atone
for a vicious shower-room prank in which she has participated,
Carrie’s classmate Susan Snell persuades her boyfriend to
invite Carrie to the Senior Prom. They are elected King and
Queen. During the celebration, another of Carrie’s classmates, the unpleasant Christine Hargensen, pulls a second
prank on Carrie, this one deadly. Carrie takes her revenge by
using her telekinetic power to kill most of her classmates
(and her atrocious mother) before dying herself. That’s the
whole deal, really; it’s as simple as a fairy-tale. There was no
need to mess it up with bells and whistles, although I did add
a number of epistolary interludes (passages from fictional
books, a diary entry, letters, teletype bulletins) between narrative segments. This was partly to inject a greater sense of
realism (I was thinking of Orson Welles’s radio adaptation of
War of the Worlds) but mostly because the first draft of the
book was so damned short it barely seemed like a novel.

On Writing

When I read Carrie over prior to starting the second draft,
I noticed there was blood at all three crucial points of the story:
beginning (Carrie’s paranormal ability is apparently brought
on by her first menstrual period), climax (the prank which sets
Carrie off at the prom involves a bucket of pig’s blood—
“pig’s blood for a pig,” Chris Hargensen tells her boyfriend),
and end (Sue Snell, the girl who tries to help Carrie, discovers
she is not pregnant as she had half-hoped and half-feared
when she gets her own period).
There’s plenty of blood in most horror stories, of course—
it is our stock-in-trade, you might say. Still, the blood in Carrie seemed more than just splatter to me. It seemed to mean
something. That meaning wasn’t consciously created, however. While writing Carrie I never once stopped to think:
“Ah, all this blood symbolism will win me Brownie Points
with the critics” or “Boy oh boy, this should certainly get me
in a college bookstore or two!” For one thing, a writer would
have to be a lot crazier than I am to think of Carrie as anyone’s intellectual treat.
Intellectual treat or not, the significance of all that blood
was hard to miss once I started reading over my beer- and teasplattered first-draft manuscript. So I started to play with the
idea, image, and emotional connotations of blood, trying to
think of as many associations as I could. There were lots, most
of them pretty heavy. Blood is strongly linked to the idea of
sacrifice; for young women it’s associated with reaching physical maturity and the ability to bear children; in the Christian
religion (plenty of others, as well), it’s symbolic of both sin
and salvation. Finally, it is associated with the handing down
of family traits and talents. We are said to look like this or
behave like that because “it’s in our blood.” We know this
isn’t very scientific, that those things are really in our genes
199

Stephen King

and DNA patterns, but we use the one to summarize the
other.
It is that ability to summarize and encapsulate that makes
symbolism so interesting, useful, and—when used well—
arresting. You could argue that it’s really just another kind of
figurative language.
Does that make it necessary to the success of your story or
novel? Indeed not, and it can actually hurt, especially if you
get carried away. Symbolism exists to adorn and enrich, not
to create a sense of artificial profundity. None of the bells and
whistles are about story, all right? Only story is about story.
(Are you tired of hearing that yet? I hope not, ’cause I’m not
even close to getting tired of saying it.)
Symbolism (and the other adornments, too) does serve a useful purpose, though—it’s more than just chrome on the grille.
It can serve as a focusing device for both you and your reader,
helping to create a more unified and pleasing work. I think
that, when you read your manuscript over (and when you talk
it over), you’ll see if symbolism, or the potential for it, exists.
If it doesn’t, leave well enough alone. If it does, however—if
it’s clearly a part of the fossil you’re working to unearth—go
for it. Enhance it. You’re a monkey if you don’t.

– 10 –
The same things are true of theme. Writing and literature
classes can be annoyingly preoccupied by (and pretentious
about) theme, approaching it as the most sacred of sacred
cows, but (don’t be shocked) it’s really no big deal. If you
write a novel, spend weeks and then months catching it word
by word, you owe it both to the book and to yourself to lean
200

On Writing

back (or take a long walk) when you’ve finished and ask
yourself why you bothered—why you spent all that time, why
it seemed so important. In other words, what’s it all about,
Alfie?
When you write a book, you spend day after day scanning
and identifying the trees. When you’re done, you have to step
back and look at the forest. Not every book has to be loaded
with symbolism, irony, or musical language (they call it prose
for a reason, y’know), but it seems to me that every book—at
least every one worth reading—is about something. Your job
during or just after the first draft is to decide what something
or somethings yours is about. Your job in the second draft—
one of them, anyway—is to make that something even more
clear. This may necessitate some big changes and revisions.
The benefits to you and your reader will be clearer focus and
a more unified story. It hardly ever fails.
The book that took me the longest to write was The Stand.
This is also the one my longtime readers still seem to like the
best (there’s something a little depressing about such a
united opinion that you did your best work twenty years ago,
but we won’t go into that just now, thanks). I finished the
first draft about sixteen months after I started it. The Stand
took an especially long time because it nearly died going into
the third turn and heading for home.
I’d wanted to write a sprawling, multi-character sort of
novel—a fantasy epic, if I could manage it—and to that end
I employed a shifting-perspective narrative, adding a major
character in each chapter of the long first section. Thus Chapter One concerned itself with Stuart Redman, a blue-collar
factory worker from Texas; Chapter Two first concerned itself
with Fran Goldsmith, a pregnant college girl from Maine, and
then returned to Stu; Chapter Three began with Larry Under201

Stephen King

wood, a rock-and-roll singer in New York, before going back
first to Fran, then to Stu Redman again.
My plan was to link all these characters, the good, the
bad, and the ugly, in two places: Boulder and Las Vegas. I
thought they’d probably end up going to war against one
another. The first half of the book also told the story of a
man-made virus which sweeps America and the world, wiping out ninety-nine per cent of the human race and utterly
destroying our technology-based culture.
I was writing this story near the end of the so-called Energy
Crisis in the 1970s, and I had an absolutely marvellous time
envisioning a world that went smash during the course of one
horrified, infected summer (really not much more than a
month). The view was panoramic, detailed, nationwide, and
(to me, at least) breathtaking. Rarely have I seen so clearly
with the eye of my imagination, from the traffic jam plugging
the dead tube of New York’s Lincoln Tunnel to the sinister,
Nazi-ish rebirth of Las Vegas under the watchful (and often
amused) red eye of Randall Flagg. All this sounds terrible, is
terrible, but to me the vision was also strangely optimistic. No
more energy crisis, for one thing, no more famine, no more
massacres in Uganda, no more acid rain or hole in the ozone
layer. Finito as well to saber-rattling nuclear superpowers, and
certainly no more overpopulation. Instead, there was a chance
for humanity’s remaining shred to start over again in a Godcentered world to which miracles, magic, and prophecy had
returned. I liked my story. I liked my characters. And still
there came a point when I couldn’t write any longer because I
didn’t know what to write. Like Pilgrim in John Bunyan’s
epic, I had come to a place where the straight way was lost. I
wasn’t the first writer to discover this awful place, and I’m a
long way from being the last; this is the land of writer’s block.
202

On Writing

If I’d had two or even three hundred pages of single-spaced
manuscript instead of more than five hundred, I think I
would have abandoned The Stand and gone on to something
else—God knows I had done it before. But five hundred
pages was too great an investment, both in time and in creative energy; I found it impossible to let go. Also, there was
this little voice whispering to me that the book was really
good, and if I didn’t finish I would regret it forever. So instead
of moving on to another project, I started taking long walks
(a habit which would, two decades later, get me in a lot of
trouble). I took a book or magazine on these walks but rarely
opened it, no matter how bored I felt looking at the same old
trees and the same old chattering, ill-natured jays and squirrels. Boredom can be a very good thing for someone in a creative jam. I spent those walks being bored and thinking
about my gigantic boondoggle of a manuscript.
For weeks I got exactly nowhere in my thinking—it all just
seemed too hard, too fucking complex. I had run out too
many plotlines, and they were in danger of becoming snarled.
I circled the problem again and again, beat my fists on it,
knocked my head against it . . . and then one day when I was
thinking of nothing much at all, the answer came to me. It
arrived whole and complete—gift-wrapped, you could say—
in a single bright flash. I ran home and jotted it down on
paper, the only time I’ve done such a thing, because I was terrified of forgetting.
What I saw was that the America in which The Stand took
place might have been depopulated by the plague, but the
world of my story had become dangerously overcrowded—a
veritable Calcutta. The solution to where I was stuck, I saw,
could be pretty much the same as the situation that got me
going—an explosion instead of a plague, but still one quick,
203

Stephen King

hard slash of the Gordian knot. I would send the survivors
west from Boulder to Las Vegas on a redemptive quest—
they would go at once, with no supplies and no plan, like
Biblical characters seeking a vision or to know the will of
God. In Vegas they would meet Randall Flagg, and good
guys and bad guys alike would be forced to make their stand.
At one moment I had none of this; at the next I had all of
it. If there is any one thing I love about writing more than the
rest, it’s that sudden flash of insight when you see how everything connects. I have heard it called “thinking above the
curve,” and it’s that; I’ve heard it called “the over-logic,” and
it’s that, too. Whatever you call it, I wrote my page or two of
notes in a frenzy of excitement and spent the next two or
three days turning my solution over in my mind, looking for
flaws and holes (also working out the actual narrative flow,
which involved two supporting characters placing a bomb in
a major character’s closet), but that was mostly out of a sense
of this-is-too-good-to-be-true unbelief. Too good or not, I
knew it was true at the moment of revelation: that bomb in
Nick Andros’s closet was going to solve all my narrative
problems. It did, too. The rest of the book ran itself off in nine
weeks.
Later, when my first draft of The Stand was done, I was able
to get a better fix on what had stopped me so completely in
mid-course; it was a lot easier to think without that voice in the
middle of my head constantly yammering “I’m losing my book!
Ah shit, five hundred pages and I’m losing my book! Condition red!
CONDITION RED!!” I was also able to analyze what got me going
again and appreciate the irony of it: I saved my book by
blowing approximately half its major characters to smithereens
(there actually ended up being two explosions, the one in
Boulder balanced by a similar act of sabotage in Las Vegas).
204

On Writing

The real source of my malaise, I decided, had been that in
the wake of the plague, my Boulder characters—the good
guys—were starting up the same old technological deathtrip.
The first hesitant CB broadcasts, beckoning people to Boulder, would soon lead to TV; infomercials and 900 numbers
would be back in no time. Same deal with the power plants.
It certainly didn’t take my Boulder folks long to decide
that seeking the will of the God who spared them was a lot
less important than getting the refrigerators and air conditioners up and running again. In Vegas, Randall Flagg and his
friends were learning how to fly jets and bombers as well as
getting the lights back on, but that was okay—to be
expected—because they were the bad guys. What had
stopped me was realizing, on some level of my mind, that the
good guys and bad guys were starting to look perilously
alike, and what got me going again was realizing the good
guys were worshipping an electronic golden calf and needed
a wake-up call. A bomb in the closet would do just fine.
All this suggested to me that violence as a solution is
woven through human nature like a damning red thread.
That became the theme of The Stand, and I wrote the second
draft with it fixed firmly in my mind. Again and again characters (the bad ones like Lloyd Henreid as well as the good ones
like Stu Redman and Larry Underwood) mention the fact that
“all that stuff [i.e., weapons of mass destruction] is just lying
around, waiting to be picked up.” When the Boulderites propose—innocently, meaning only the best—to rebuild the
same old neon Tower of Babel, they are wiped out by more violence. The folks who plant the bomb are doing what Randall
Flagg told them to, but Mother Abagail, Flagg’s opposite
number, says again and again that “all things serve God.” If
this is true—and within the context of The Stand it certainly
205

Stephen King

is—then the bomb is actually a stern message from the guy
upstairs, a way of saying “I didn’t bring you all this way just so
you could start up the same old shit.”
Near the end of the novel (it was the end of the first,
shorter version of the story), Fran asks Stuart Redman if
there’s any hope at all, if people ever learn from their mistakes.
Stu replies, “I don’t know,” and then pauses. In story-time, that
pause lasts only as long as it takes the reader to flick his or her
eye to the last line. In the writer’s study, it went on a lot longer.
I searched my mind and heart for something else Stu could say,
some clarifying statement. I wanted to find it because at that
moment if at no other, Stu was speaking for me. In the end,
however, Stu simply repeats what he has already said: I don’t
know. It was the best I could do. Sometimes the book gives you
answers, but not always, and I didn’t want to leave the readers who had followed me through hundreds of pages with
nothing but some empty platitude I didn’t believe myself.
There is no moral to The Stand, no “We’d better learn or we’ll
probably destroy the whole damned planet next time”—but
if the theme stands out clearly enough, those discussing it may
offer their own morals and conclusions. Nothing wrong with
that; such discussions are one of the great pleasures of the reading life.
Although I’d used symbolism, imagery, and literary homage
before getting to my novel about the big plague (without
Dracula, for instance, I think there is no ’Salem’s Lot), I’m quite
sure that I never thought much about theme before getting
roadblocked on The Stand. I suppose I thought such things
were for Better Minds and Bigger Thinkers. I’m not sure I
would have gotten to it as soon as I did, had I not been desperate to save my story.
I was astounded at how really useful “thematic thinking”
206

On Writing

turned out to be. It wasn’t just a vaporous idea that English
professors made you write about on midterm essay exams
(“Discuss the thematic concerns of Wise Blood in three wellreasoned paragraphs—30 pts”), but another handy gadget
to keep in the toolbox, this one something like a magnifying
glass.
Since my revelation on the road concerning the bomb in
the closet, I have never hesitated to ask myself, either before
starting the second draft of a book or while stuck for an idea
in the first draft, just what it is I’m writing about, why I’m
spending the time when I could be playing my guitar or riding my motorcycle, what got my nose down to the grindstone in the first place and then kept it there. The answer
doesn’t always come right away, but there usually is one, and
it’s usually not too hard to find, either.
I don’t believe any novelist, even one who’s written fortyplus books, has too many thematic concerns; I have many
interests, but only a few that are deep enough to power novels. These deep interests (I won’t quite call them obsessions)
include how difficult it is—perhaps impossible!—to close
Pandora’s technobox once it’s open (The Stand, The Tommyknockers, Firestarter); the question of why, if there is a God, such
terrible things happen (The Stand, Desperation, The Green
Mile); the thin line between reality and fantasy (The Dark Half,
Bag of Bones, The Drawing of the Three); and most of all, the terrible attraction violence sometimes has for fundamentally
good people (The Shining, The Dark Half). I’ve also written
again and again about the fundamental differences between
children and adults, and about the healing power of the
human imagination.
And I repeat: no big deal. These are just interests which
have grown out of my life and thought, out of my experi207

Stephen King

ences as a boy and a man, out of my roles as a husband, a
father, a writer, and a lover. They are questions that occupy
my mind when I turn out the lights for the night and I’m
alone with myself, looking up into the darkness with one
hand tucked beneath the pillow.
You undoubtedly have your own thoughts, interests, and
concerns, and they have arisen, as mine have, from your
experiences and adventures as a human being. Some are
likely similar to those I’ve mentioned above and some are
likely very different, but you have them, and you should use
them in your work. That’s not all those ideas are there for,
perhaps, but surely it’s one of the things they are good for.
I should close this little sermonette with a word of warning—starting with the questions and thematic concerns is a
recipe for bad fiction. Good fiction always begins with story
and progresses to theme; it almost never begins with theme
and progresses to story. The only possible exceptions to this
rule that I can think of are allegories like George Orwell’s
Animal Farm (and I have a sneaking suspicion that with Animal Farm the story idea may indeed have come first; if I see
Orwell in the afterlife, I mean to ask him).
But once your basic story is on paper, you need to think
about what it means and enrich your following drafts with
your conclusions. To do less is to rob your work (and eventually your readers) of the vision that makes each tale you write
uniquely your own.

– 11 –
So far, so good. Now let’s talk about revising the work—how
much and how many drafts? For me the answer has always
208

On Writing

been two drafts and a polish (with the advent of wordprocessing technology, my polishes have become closer to a
third draft).
You should realize that I’m only talking about my own personal mode of writing here; in actual practice, rewriting varies
greatly from writer to writer. Kurt Vonnegut, for example,
rewrote each page of his novels until he got them exactly the
way he wanted them. The result was days when he might
only manage a page or two of finished copy (and the wastebasket would be full of crumpled, rejected page seventy-ones
and seventy-twos), but when the manuscript was finished, the
book was finished, by gum. You could set it in type. Yet I think
certain things hold true for most writers, and those are the
ones I want to talk about now. If you’ve been writing awhile,
you won’t need me to help you much with this part; you’ll
have your own established routine. If you’re a beginner,
though, let me urge that you take your story through at
least two drafts; the one you do with the study door closed
and the one you do with it open.
With the door shut, downloading what’s in my head
directly to the page, I write as fast as I can and still remain
comfortable. Writing fiction, especially a long work of fiction,
can be a difficult, lonely job; it’s like crossing the Atlantic
Ocean in a bathtub. There’s plenty of opportunity for selfdoubt. If I write rapidly, putting down my story exactly as it
comes into my mind, only looking back to check the names of
my characters and the relevant parts of their back stories, I
find that I can keep up with my original enthusiasm and at
the same time outrun the self-doubt that’s always waiting to
settle in.
This first draft—the All-Story Draft—should be written
with no help (or interference) from anyone else. There may
209

Stephen King

come a point when you want to show what you’re doing to a
close friend (very often the close friend you think of first is
the one who shares your bed), either because you’re proud of
what you’re doing or because you’re doubtful about it. My
best advice is to resist this impulse. Keep the pressure on;
don’t lower it by exposing what you’ve written to the doubt,
the praise, or even the well-meaning questions of someone
from the Outside World. Let your hope of success (and your
fear of failure) carry you on, difficult as that can be. There’ll
be time to show off what you’ve done when you finish . . . but
even after finishing I think you must be cautious and give
yourself a chance to think while the story is still like a field of
freshly fallen snow, absent of any tracks save your own.
The great thing about writing with the door shut is that
you find yourself forced to concentrate on story to the exclusion of practically everything else. No one can ask you “What
were you trying to express with Garfield’s dying words?” or
“What’s the significance of the green dress?” You may not
have been trying to express anything with Garfield’s dying
words, and Maura could be wearing green only because that’s
what you saw when she came into sight in your mind’s eye.
On the other hand, perhaps those things do mean something
(or will, when you get a chance to look at the forest instead of
the trees). Either way, the first draft is the wrong place to
think about it.
Here’s something else—if no one says to you, “Oh Sam (or
Amy)! This is wonderful!,” you are a lot less apt to slack off or
to start concentrating on the wrong thing . . . being wonderful,
for instance, instead of telling the goddam story.
Now let’s say you’ve finished your first draft. Congratulations! Good job! Have a glass of champagne, send out for
pizza, do whatever it is you do when you’ve got something to
210

On Writing

celebrate. If you have someone who has been impatiently
waiting to read your novel—a spouse, let’s say, someone who
has perhaps been working nine to five and helping to pay the
bills while you chase your dream—then this is the time to
give up the goods . . . if, that is, your first reader or readers
will promise not to talk to you about the book until you are
ready to talk to them about it.
This may sound a little high-handed, but it’s really not.
You’ve done a lot of work and you need a period of time (how
much or how little depends on the individual writer) to rest.
Your mind and imagination—two things which are related,
but not really the same—have to recycle themselves, at least
in regard to this one particular work. My advice is that you
take a couple of days off—go fishing, go kayaking, do a jigsaw puzzle—and then go to work on something else. Something shorter, preferably, and something that’s a complete
change of direction and pace from your newly finished book.
(I wrote some pretty good novellas, “The Body” and “Apt
Pupil” among them, between drafts of longer works like The
Dead Zone and The Dark Half.)
How long you let your book rest—sort of like bread
dough between kneadings—is entirely up to you, but I think
it should be a minimum of six weeks. During this time your
manuscript will be safely shut away in a desk drawer, aging
and (one hopes) mellowing. Your thoughts will turn to it frequently, and you’ll likely be tempted a dozen times or more
to take it out, if only to re-read some passage that seems particularly fine in your memory, something you’d like to go
back to so you can re-experience what a really excellent
writer you are.
Resist temptation. If you don’t, you’ll very likely decide
you didn’t do as well on that passage as you thought and
211

Stephen King

you’d better retool it on the spot. This is bad. The only thing
worse would be for you to decide the passage is even better
than you remembered—why not drop everything and read
the whole book over right then? Get back to work on it!
Hell, you’re ready! You’re fuckin Shakespeare!
You’re not, though, and you’re not ready to go back to the
old project until you’ve gotten so involved in a new one (or
re-involved in your day-to-day life) that you’ve almost forgotten the unreal estate that took up three hours of your
every morning or afternoon for a period of three or five or
seven months.
When you come to the correct evening (which you well
may have marked on your office calendar), take your manuscript out of the drawer. If it looks like an alien relic bought
at a junk-shop or yard sale where you can hardly remember
stopping, you’re ready. Sit down with your door shut (you’ll
be opening it to the world soon enough), a pencil in your
hand, and a legal pad by your side. Then read your manuscript over.
Do it all in one sitting, if that’s possible (it won’t be, of
course, if your book is a four- or five-hundred-pager). Make
all the notes you want, but concentrate on the mundane
housekeeping jobs, like fixing misspellings and picking up
inconsistencies. There’ll be plenty; only God gets it right the
first time and only a slob says, “Oh well, let it go, that’s what
copyeditors are for.”
If you’ve never done it before, you’ll find reading your
book over after a six-week layoff to be a strange, often exhilarating experience. It’s yours, you’ll recognize it as yours,
even be able to remember what tune was on the stereo when
you wrote certain lines, and yet it will also be like reading the
work of someone else, a soul-twin, perhaps. This is the way it
212

On Writing

should be, the reason you waited. It’s always easier to kill
someone else’s darlings than it is to kill your own.
With six weeks’ worth of recuperation time, you’ll also be
able to see any glaring holes in the plot or character development. I’m talking about holes big enough to drive a truck
through. It’s amazing how some of these things can elude the
writer while he or she is occupied with the daily work of
composition. And listen—if you spot a few of these big holes,
you are forbidden to feel depressed about them or to beat up
on yourself. Screw-ups happen to the best of us. There’s a
story that the architect of the Flatiron Building committed
suicide when he realized, just before the ribbon-cutting ceremony, that he had neglected to put any men’s rooms in his
prototypical skyscraper. Probably not true, but remember
this: someone really did design the Titanic and then label it
unsinkable.
For me, the most glaring errors I find on the re-read have
to do with character motivation (related to character development but not quite the same). I’ll smack myself upside the
head with the heel of my palm, then grab my legal pad and
write something like p. 91: Sandy Hunter filches a buck
from Shirley’s stash in the dispatch office. Why? God’s
sake, Sandy would NEVER do anything like this! I also
mark the page in the manuscript with a big
symbol,
meaning that cuts and/or changes are needed on this page,
and reminding myself to check my notes for the exact details
if I don’t remember them.
I love this part of the process (well, I love all the parts of
the process, but this one is especially nice) because I’m rediscovering my own book, and usually liking it. That changes.
By the time a book is actually in print, I’ve been over it a
dozen times or more, can quote whole passages, and only
213

Stephen King

wish the damned old smelly thing would go away. That’s
later, though; the first read-through is usually pretty fine.
During that reading, the top part of my mind is concentrating on story and toolbox concerns: knocking out pronouns with unclear antecedents (I hate and mistrust
pronouns, every one of them as slippery as a fly-by-night personal-injury lawyer), adding clarifying phrases where they
seem necessary, and of course, deleting all the adverbs I can
bear to part with (never all of them; never enough).
Underneath, however, I’m asking myself the Big Questions. The biggest: Is this story coherent? And if it is, what
will turn coherence into a song? What are the recurring elements? Do they entwine and make a theme? I’m asking
myself What’s it all about, Stevie, in other words, and what I
can do to make those underlying concerns even clearer.
What I want most of all is resonance, something that will
linger for a little while in Constant Reader’s mind (and heart)
after he or she has closed the book and put it up on the shelf.
I’m looking for ways to do that without spoon-feeding the
reader or selling my birthright for a plot of message. Take all
those messages and those morals and stick em where the sun
don’t shine, all right? I want resonance. Most of all, I’m looking for what I meant, because in the second draft I’ll want to
add scenes and incidents that reinforce that meaning. I’ll also
want to delete stuff that goes in other directions. There’s apt
to be a lot of that stuff, especially near the beginning of a
story, when I have a tendency to flail. All that thrashing
around has to go if I am to achieve anything like a unified
effect. When I’ve finished reading and making all my little
anal-retentive revisions, it’s time to open the door and show
what I’ve written to four or five close friends who have indicated a willingness to look.
214

On Writing

Someone—I can’t remember who, for the life of me—
once wrote that all novels are really letters aimed at one person. As it happens, I believe this. I think that every novelist
has a single ideal reader; that at various points during the
composition of a story, the writer is thinking, “I wonder what
he/she will think when he/she reads this part?” For me that
first reader is my wife, Tabitha.
She has always been an extremely sympathetic and supportive first reader. Her positive reaction to difficult books
like Bag of Bones (my first novel with a new publisher after
twenty good years with Viking that came to an end in a stupid squabble about money) and relatively controversial ones
like Gerald’s Game meant the world to me. But she’s also
unflinching when she sees something she thinks is wrong.
When she does, she lets me know loud and clear.
In her role as critic and first reader, Tabby often makes me
think of a story I read about Alfred Hitchcock’s wife, Alma
Reville. Ms. Reville was the equivalent of Hitch’s first reader,
a sharp-eyed critic who was totally unimpressed with the
suspense-master’s growing reputation as an auteur. Lucky for
him. Hitch say he want to fly, Alma say, “First eat your eggs.”
Not long after finishing Psycho, Hitchcock screened it for a
few friends. They raved about it, declaring it to be a suspense
masterpiece. Alma was quiet until they’d all had their say,
then spoke very firmly: “You can’t send it out like that.”
There was a thunderstruck silence, except for Hitchcock
himself, who only asked why not. “Because,” his wife
responded, “Janet Leigh swallows when she’s supposed to be
dead.” It was true. Hitchcock didn’t argue any more than I do
when Tabby points out one of my lapses. She and I may
argue about many aspects of a book, and there have been times
when I’ve gone against her judgment on subjective matters,
215

Stephen King

but when she catches me in a goof, I know it, and thank God
I’ve got someone around who’ll tell me my fly’s unzipped
before I go out in public that way.
In addition to Tabby’s first read, I usually send manuscripts to between four and eight other people who have critiqued my stories over the years. Many writing texts caution
against asking friends to read your stuff, suggesting you’re not
apt to get a very unbiased opinion from folks who’ve eaten dinner at your house and sent their kids over to play with your
kids in your backyard. It’s unfair, according to this view, to put
a pal in such a position. What happens if he/she feels he/she has
to say, “I’m sorry, good buddy, you’ve written some great
yarns in the past but this one sucks like a vacuum cleaner”?
The idea has some validity, but I don’t think an unbiased
opinion is exactly what I’m looking for. And I believe that most
people smart enough to read a novel are also tactful enough to
find a gentler mode of expression than “This sucks.” (Although
most of us know that “I think this has a few problems” actually means “This sucks,” don’t we?) Besides, if you really did
write a stinker—it happens; as the author of Maximum Overdrive I’m qualified to say so—wouldn’t you rather hear the
news from a friend while the entire edition consists of a halfdozen Xerox copies?
When you give out six or eight copies of a book, you get
back six or eight highly subjective opinions about what’s
good and what’s bad in it. If all your readers think you did a
pretty good job, you probably did. This sort of unanimity does
happen, but it’s rare, even with friends. More likely, they’ll
think that some parts are good and some parts are . . . well,
not so good. Some will feel Character A works but Character
B is far-fetched. If others feel that Character B is believable
but Character A is overdrawn, it’s a wash. You can safely
216

On Writing

relax and leave things the way they are (in baseball, tie goes to
the runner; for novelists, it goes to the writer). If some people
love your ending and others hate it, same deal—it’s a wash,
and tie goes to the writer.
Some first readers specialize in pointing out factual errors,
which are the easiest to deal with. One of my first-reader smart
guys, the late Mac McCutcheon, a wonderful high school
English teacher, knew a lot about guns. If I had a character toting a Winchester .330, Mac might jot in the margin that Winchester didn’t make that caliber but Remington did. In such
cases you’ve got two for the price of one—the error and the fix.
It’s a good deal, because you come off looking like you’re an
expert and your first reader will feel flattered to have been of
help. And the best catch Mac ever made for me had nothing
to do with guns. One day while reading a piece of a manuscript
in the teachers’ room, he burst out laughing—laughed so hard,
in fact, that tears went rolling down his bearded cheeks.
Because the story in question, ’Salem’s Lot, had not been
intended as a laff riot, I asked him what he had found. I had
written a line that went something like this: Although deer
season doesn’t start until November in Maine, the fields
of October are often alive with gunshots; the locals are
shooting as many peasants as they think their families will
eat. A copyeditor would no doubt have picked up the mistake,
but Mac spared me that embarrassment.
Subjective evaluations are, as I say, a little harder to deal
with, but listen: if everyone who reads your book says you have
a problem (Connie comes back to her husband too easily,
Hal’s cheating on the big exam seems unrealistic given what
we know about him, the novel’s conclusion seems abrupt
and arbitrary), you’ve got a problem and you better do something about it.
217

Stephen King

Plenty of writers resist this idea. They feel that revising a
story according to the likes and dislikes of an audience is
somehow akin to prostitution. If you really feel that way, I
won’t try to change your mind. You’ll save on charges at
Copy Cop, too, because you won’t have to show anyone your
story in the first place. In fact (he said snottily), if you really
feel that way, why bother to publish at all? Just finish your
books and then pop them in a safe-deposit box, as J. D.
Salinger is reputed to have been doing in his later years.
And yes, I can relate, at least a bit, to that sort of resentment. In the film business, where I have had a quasi-professional life, first-draft showings are called “test screenings.”
These have become standard practice in the industry, and
they drive most filmmakers absolutely bugshit. Maybe they
should. The studio shells out somewhere between fifteen and
a hundred million dollars to make a film, then asks the director to recut it based on the opinions of a Santa Barbara multiplex audience composed of hairdressers, meter maids,
shoe-store clerks, and out-of-work pizza-delivery guys. And
the worst, most maddening thing about it? If you get the
demographic right, test screenings seem to work.
I’d hate to see novels revised on the basis of test audiences—a lot of good books would never see the light of day if
it was done that way—but come on, we’re talking about half
a dozen people you know and respect. If you ask the right ones
(and if they agree to read your book), they can tell you a lot.
Do all opinions weigh the same? Not for me. In the end I
listen most closely to Tabby, because she’s the one I write for,
the one I want to wow. If you’re writing primarily for one
person besides yourself, I’d advise you to pay very close
attention to that person’s opinion (I know one fellow who
says he writes mostly for someone who’s been dead fifteen
218

On Writing

years, but the majority of us aren’t in that position). And if
what you hear makes sense, then make the changes. You
can’t let the whole world into your story, but you can let in
the ones that matter the most. And you should.
Call that one person you write for Ideal Reader. He or she
is going to be in your writing room all the time: in the flesh
once you open the door and let the world back in to shine on
the bubble of your dream, in spirit during the sometimes
troubling and often exhilarating days of the first draft, when
the door is closed. And you know what? You’ll find yourself
bending the story even before Ideal Reader glimpses so much
as the first sentence. I.R. will help you get outside yourself a
little, to actually read your work in progress as an audience
would while you’re still working. This is perhaps the best
way of all to make sure you stick to story, a way of playing to
the audience even while there’s no audience there and you’re
totally in charge.
When I write a scene that strikes me as funny (like the pieeating contest in “The Body” or the execution rehearsal in The
Green Mile), I am also imagining my I.R. finding it funny. I
love it when Tabby laughs out of control—she puts her hands
up as if to say I surrender and these big tears go rolling down
her cheeks. I love it, that’s all, fucking adore it, and when I
get hold of something with that potential, I twist it as hard as
I can. During the actual writing of such a scene (door closed),
the thought of making her laugh—or cry—is in the back of
my mind. During the rewrite (door open), the question—is it
funny enough yet? scary enough?—is right up front. I try to
watch her when she gets to a particular scene, hoping for at
least a smile or—jackpot, baby!—that big belly-laugh with
the hands up, waving in the air.
This isn’t always easy on her. I gave her the manuscript of
219

Stephen King

my novella Hearts in Atlantis while we were in North Carolina,
where we’d gone to see a Cleveland Rockers–Charlotte Sting
WNBA game. We drove north to Virginia the following day,
and it was during this drive that Tabby read my story. There
are some funny parts in it—at least I thought so—and I
kept peeking over at her to see if she was chuckling (or at least
smiling). I didn’t think she’d notice, but of course she did. On
my eighth or ninth peek (I guess it could have been my fifteenth), she looked up and snapped: “Pay attention to your
driving before you crack us up, will you? Stop being so goddam needy!”
I paid attention to my driving and stopped sneaking peeks
(well . . . almost). About five minutes later, I heard a snort of
laughter from my right. Just a little one, but it was enough
for me. The truth is that most writers are needy. Especially
between the first draft and the second, when the study door
swings open and the light of the world shines in.

Ideal Reader is also the best way for you to gauge whether or
not your story is paced correctly and if you’ve handled the
back story in satisfactory fashion.
Pace is the speed at which your narrative unfolds. There is a
kind of unspoken (hence undefended and unexamined) belief
in publishing circles that the most commercially successful stories and novels are fast-paced. I guess the underlying thought
is that people have so many things to do today, and are so easily distracted from the printed word, that you’ll lose them
unless you become a kind of short-order cook, serving up sizzling burgers, fries, and eggs over easy just as fast as you can.
220

On Writing

Like so many unexamined beliefs in the publishing business, this idea is largely bullshit . . . which is why, when
books like Umberto Eco’s The Name of the Rose or Charles Frazier’s Cold Mountain suddenly break out of the pack and
climb the best-seller lists, publishers and editors are astonished. I suspect that most of them ascribe these books’ unexpected success to unpredictable and deplorable lapses into
good taste on the part of the reading public.
Not that there’s anything wrong with rapidly paced novels.
Some pretty good writers—Nelson DeMille, Wilbur Smith,
and Sue Grafton, to name just three—have made millions
writing them. But you can overdo the speed thing. Move too
fast and you risk leaving the reader behind, either by confusing or by wearing him/her out. And for myself, I like a slower
pace and a bigger, higher build. The leisurely luxury-liner
experience of a long, absorbing novel like The Far Pavilions or
A Suitable Boy has been one of the form’s chief attractions since
the first examples—endless, multipart epistolary tales like
Clarissa. I believe each story should be allowed to unfold at its
own pace, and that pace is not always double time. Nevertheless, you need to beware—if you slow the pace down too
much, even the most patient reader is apt to grow restive.
The best way to find the happy medium? Ideal Reader, of
course. Try to imagine whether he or she will be bored by a
certain scene—if you know the tastes of your I.R. even half
as well as I know the tastes of mine, that shouldn’t be too
hard. Is I.R. going to feel there’s too much pointless talk in
this place or that? That you’ve underexplained a certain situation . . . or overexplained it, which is one of my chronic failings? That you forgot to resolve some important plot point?
Forgot an entire character, as Raymond Chandler once did?
(When asked about the murdered chauffeur in The Big Sleep,
221

Stephen King

Chandler—who liked his tipple—replied, “Oh, him. You
know, I forgot all about him.”) These questions should be in
your mind even with the door closed. And once it’s open—
once your Ideal Reader has actually read your manuscript—
you should ask your questions out loud. Also, needy or not,
you might want to watch and see when your I.R. puts your
manuscript down to do something else. What scene was he
or she reading? What was so easy to put down?
Mostly when I think of pacing, I go back to Elmore
Leonard, who explained it so perfectly by saying he just left
out the boring parts. This suggests cutting to speed the pace,
and that’s what most of us end up having to do (kill your darlings, kill your darlings, even when it breaks your egocentric
little scribbler’s heart, kill your darlings).
As a teenager, sending out stories to magazines like Fantasy and Science Fiction and Ellery Queen’s Mystery Magazine, I
got used to the sort of rejection note that starts Dear Contributor (might as well start off Dear Chump), and so came to relish any little personal dash on these printed pink-slips. They
were few and far between, but when they came they never
failed to lighten my day and put a smile on my face.
In the spring of my senior year at Lisbon High—1966, this
would’ve been—I got a scribbled comment that changed the
way I rewrote my fiction once and forever. Jotted below
the machine-generated signature of the editor was this mot:
“Not bad, but PUFFY. You need to revise for length. Formula:
2nd Draft = 1st Draft – 10%. Good luck.”
I wish I could remember who wrote that note—Algis
Budrys, perhaps. Whoever it was did me a hell of a favor. I
copied the formula out on a piece of shirt-cardboard and
taped it to the wall beside my typewriter. Good things
started to happen for me shortly after. There was no sudden
222

On Writing

golden flood of magazine sales, but the number of personal
notes on the rejection slips went up fast. I even got one from
Durant Imboden, the fiction editor at Playboy. That communiqué almost stopped my heart. Playboy paid two thousand
dollars and up for short stories, and two grand was a quarter
of what my mother made each year in her housekeeping job
at Pineland Training Center.
The Rewrite Formula probably wasn’t the only reason I
started to get some results; I suspect another was that it was
just my time, coming around at last (sort of like Yeats’s rough
beast). Still, the Formula was surely part of it. Before the Formula, if I produced a story that was four thousand words or so
in first draft, it was apt to be five thousand in second (some
writers are taker-outers; I’m afraid I’ve always been a natural
putter-inner). After the Formula, that changed. Even today I
will aim for a second-draft length of thirty-six hundred words
if the first draft of a story ran four thousand . . . and if the first
draft of a novel runs three hundred and fifty thousand words,
I’ll try my damndest to produce a second draft of no more
than three hundred and fifteen thousand . . . three hundred,
if possible. Usually it is possible. What the Formula taught
me is that every story and novel is collapsible to some degree.
If you can’t get out ten per cent of it while retaining the basic
story and flavor, you’re not trying very hard. The effect of
judicious cutting is immediate and often amazing—literary
Viagra. You’ll feel it and your I.R. will, too.
Back story is all the stuff that happened before your tale
began but which has an impact on the front story. Back story
helps define character and establish motivation. I think it’s
important to get the back story in as quickly as possible, but
it’s also important to do it with some grace. As an example of
what’s not graceful, consider this line of dialogue:
223

Stephen King
“Hello, ex-wife,” Tom said to Doris as she entered the
room.

Now, it may be important to the story that Tom and Doris
are divorced, but there has to be a better way to do it than the
above, which is about as graceful as an axe-murder. Here is
one suggestion:
“Hi, Doris,” Tom said. His voice sounded natural
enough—to his own ears, at least—but the fingers of
his right hand crept to the place where his wedding ring
had been until six months ago.

Still no Pulitzer winner, and quite a bit longer than Hello,
ex-wife, but it’s not all about speed, as I’ve already tried to
point out. And if you think it’s all about information, you
ought to give up fiction and get a job writing instruction
manuals—Dilbert’s cubicle awaits.
You’ve probably heard the phrase in medias res, which
means “into the midst of things.” This technique is an
ancient and honorable one, but I don’t like it. In medias res
necessitates flashbacks, which strike me as boring and sort of
corny. They always make me think of those movies from the
forties and fifties where the picture gets all swimmy, the
voices get all echoey, and suddenly it’s sixteen months ago
and the mud-splashed convict we just saw trying to outrun
the bloodhounds is an up-and-coming young lawyer who
hasn’t yet been framed for the murder of the crooked police
chief.
As a reader, I’m a lot more interested in what’s going to
happen than what already did. Yes, there are brilliant novels
that run counter to this preference (or maybe it’s a preju224

On Writing

dice)—Rebecca, by Daphne du Maurier, for one; A DarkAdapted Eye, by Barbara Vine, for another—but I like to start
at square one, dead even with the writer. I’m an A-to-Z man;
serve me the appetizer first and give me dessert if I eat my
veggies.
Even when you tell your story in this straightforward manner, you’ll discover you can’t escape at least some back story. In
a very real sense, every life is in medias res. If you introduce a
forty-year-old man as your main character on page one of your
novel, and if the action begins as the result of some brand-new
person or situation’s exploding onto the stage of this fellow’s
life—a road accident, let’s say, or doing a favor for a beautiful
woman who keeps looking sexily back over her shoulder (did
you note the awful adverb in this sentence which I could not
bring myself to kill?)—you’ll still have to deal with the first
forty years of the guy’s life at some point. How much and
how well you deal with those years will have a lot to do with
the level of success your story achieves, with whether readers
think of it as “a good read” or “a big fat bore.” Probably J. K.
Rowling, author of the Harry Potter stories, is the current
champ when it comes to back story. You could do worse than
read these, noting how effortlessly each new book recaps
what has gone before. (Also, the Harry Potter novels are just
fun, pure story from beginning to end.)
Your Ideal Reader can be of tremendous help when it
comes to figuring out how well you did with the back story
and how much you should add or subtract on your next
draft. You need to listen very carefully to the things I.R.
didn’t understand, and then ask yourself if you understand
them. If you do and just didn’t put those parts across, your
job on the second draft is to clarify. If you don’t—if the parts
of the back story your Ideal Reader queried are hazy to you,
225

Stephen King

as well—then you need to think a lot more carefully about
the past events that cast a light on your characters’ present
behavior.
You also need to pay close attention to those things in the
back story that bored your Ideal Reader. In Bag of Bones, for
instance, main character Mike Noonan is a fortyish writer
who, as the book opens, has just lost his wife to a brain
aneurysm. We start on the day of her death, but there’s still a
hell of a lot of back story here, much more than I usually have
in my fiction. This includes Mike’s first job (as a newspaper
reporter), the sale of his first novel, his relations with his late
wife’s sprawling family, his publishing history, and especially
the matter of their summer home in western Maine—how
they came to buy it and some of its pre–Mike-and-Johanna
history. Tabitha, my I.R., read all this with apparent enjoyment, but there was also a two- or three-page section about
Mike’s community-service work in the year after his wife
dies, a year in which his grief is magnified by a severe case of
writer’s block. Tabby didn’t like the community-service stuff.
“Who cares?” she asked me. “I want to know more about
his bad dreams, not how he ran for city council in order to
help get the homeless alcoholics off the street.”
“Yeah, but he’s got writer’s block,” I said. (When a novelist
is challenged on something he likes—one of his darlings—
the first two words out of his mouth are almost always Yeah
but.) “This block goes on for a year, maybe more. He has to
do something in all that time, doesn’t he?”
“I guess so,” Tabby said, “but you don’t have to bore me
with it, do you?”
Ouch. Game, set, and match. Like most good I.R.s, Tabby
can be ruthless when she’s right.
I cut down Mike’s charitable contributions and community
226

On Writing

functions from two pages to two paragraphs. It turned out
that Tabby was right—as soon as I saw it in print, I knew.
Three million people or so have read Bag of Bones, I’ve gotten
at least four thousand letters concerning it, and so far not a
single one has said, “Hey, turkey! What was Mike doing for
community-service work during the year he couldn’t write?”
The most important things to remember about back story
are that (a) everyone has a history and (b) most of it isn’t very
interesting. Stick to the parts that are, and don’t get carried
away with the rest. Long life stories are best received in bars,
and only then an hour or so before closing time, and if you
are buying.

– 13 –
We need to talk a bit about research, which is a specialized
kind of back story. And please, if you do need to do research
because parts of your story deal with things about which you
know little or nothing, remember that word back. That’s
where research belongs: as far in the background and the
back story as you can get it. You may be entranced with what
you’re learning about flesh-eating bacteria, the sewer system
of New York, or the I.Q. potential of collie pups, but your
readers are probably going to care a lot more about your
characters and your story.
Exceptions to the rule? Sure, aren’t there always? There
have been very successful writers—Arthur Hailey and James
Michener are the first ones that come to my mind—whose
novels rely heavily on fact and research. Hailey’s are barely
disguised manuals about how things work (banks, airports,
hotels), and Michener’s are combination travelogues, geogra227

Stephen King

phy lessons, and history texts. Other popular writers, like Tom
Clancy and Patricia Cornwell, are more story-oriented but still
deliver large (and sometimes hard to digest) dollops of factual
information along with the melodrama. I sometimes think
that these writers appeal to a large segment of the reading
population who feel that fiction is somehow immoral, a low
taste which can only be justified by saying, “Well, ahem, yes,
I do read [Fill in author’s name here], but only on airplanes
and in hotel rooms that don’t have CNN; also, I learned a
great deal about [Fill in appropriate subject here].”
For every successful writer of the factoid type, however,
there are a hundred (perhaps even a thousand) wannabes, some
published, most not. On the whole, I think story belongs in
front, but some research is inevitable; you shirk it at your peril.
In the spring of 1999 I drove from Florida, where my wife
and I had wintered, back to Maine. My second day on the
road, I stopped for gas at a little station just off the Pennsylvania Turnpike, one of those amusingly antique places where
a fellow still comes out, pumps your gas, and asks how you’re
doing and who you like in the NCAA tournament.
I told this one I was doing fine and liked Duke in the tournament. Then I went around back to use the men’s room.
There was a brawling stream full of snowmelt beyond the station, and when I came out of the men’s, I walked a little way
down the slope, which was littered with cast-off tire-rims and
engine parts, for a closer look at the water. There were still
patches of snow on the ground. I slipped on one and started to
slide down the embankment. I grabbed a piece of someone’s
old engine block and stopped myself before I got fairly
started, but I realized as I got up that if I’d fallen just right, I
could have slid all the way down into that stream and been
swept away. I found myself wondering, had that happened,
228

On Writing

how long it would have taken the gas station attendant to
call the State Police if my car, a brand-new Lincoln Navigator,
just continued to stand there in front of the pumps. By the
time I got back on the turnpike again, I had two things: a wet
ass from my fall behind the Mobil station, and a great idea for
a story.
In it, a mysterious man in a black coat—likely not a
human being at all but some creature inexpertly disguised to
look like one—abandons his vehicle in front of a small gas
station in rural Pennsylvania. The vehicle looks like an old
Buick Special from the late fifties, but it’s no more a Buick
than the guy in the black coat was a human being. The vehicle falls into the hands of some State Police officers working
out of a fictional barracks in western Pennsylvania. Twenty
years or so later, these cops tell the story of the Buick to the
grief-stricken son of a State Policeman who has been killed in
the line of duty.
It was a grand idea and has developed into a strong novel
about how we hand down our knowledge and our secrets; it’s
also a grim and frightening story about an alien piece of
machinery that sometimes reaches out and swallows people
whole. Of course there were a few minor problems—the fact
that I knew absolutely zilch about the Pennsylvania State
Police, for one thing—but I didn’t let any of that bother me.
I simply made up all the stuff I didn’t know.
I could do that because I was writing with the door shut—
writing only for myself and the Ideal Reader in my mind (my
mental version of Tabby is rarely as prickly as my real-life
wife can be; in my daydreams she usually applauds and urges
me ever onward with shining eyes). One of my most memorable sessions took place in a fourth-floor room of Boston’s
Eliot Hotel—me sitting at the desk by the window, writing
229

Stephen King

about an autopsy on an alien bat-creature while the Boston
Marathon flowed exuberantly by just below me and rooftop
boomboxes blasted out “Dirty Water,” by The Standells.
There were a thousand people down there below me in the
streets, but not a single one in my room to be a party-pooper
and tell me I got this detail wrong or the cops don’t do things
that way in western Pennsylvania, so nyah-nyah-nyah.
The novel—it’s called From a Buick Eight—has been set
aside in a desk drawer since late May of 1999, when the first
draft was finished. Work on it has been delayed by circumstances beyond my control, but eventually I hope and expect
to spend a couple of weeks in western Pennsylvania, where
I’ve been given conditional permission to do some ridealongs with the State Police (the condition—which seems
eminently reasonable to me—was that I not make them look
like meanies, maniacs, or idiots). Once I’ve done that, I
should be able to correct the worst of my howlers and add
some really nice detail-work.
Not much, though; research is back story, and the key
word in back story is back. The tale I have to tell in Buick Eight
has to do with monsters and secrets. It is not a story about
police procedure in western Pennsylvania. What I’m looking
for is nothing but a touch of verisimilitude, like the handful of
spices you chuck into a good spaghetti sauce to really finish
her off. That sense of reality is important in any work of fiction, but I think it is particularly important in a story dealing
with the abnormal or paranormal. Also, enough details—
always assuming they are the correct ones—can stem the
tide of letters from picky-ass readers who apparently live to
tell writers that they messed up (the tone of these letters is
unvaryingly gleeful). When you step away from the “write
what you know” rule, research becomes inevitable, and it
230

On Writing

can add a lot to your story. Just don’t end up with the tail
wagging the dog; remember that you are writing a novel, not
a research paper. The story always comes first. I think that
even James Michener and Arthur Hailey would have agreed
with that.

– 14 –
I’m often asked if I think the beginning writer of fiction can
benefit from writing classes or seminars. The people who ask
are, all too often, looking for a magic bullet or a secret ingredient or possibly Dumbo’s magic feather, none of which can
be found in classrooms or at writing retreats, no matter how
enticing the brochures may be. As for myself, I’m doubtful
about writing classes, but not entirely against them.
In T. Coraghessan Boyle’s wonderful tragicomic novel
East Is East, there is a description of a writer’s colony in the
woods that struck me as fairy-tale perfect. Each attendee has
his or her own little cabin where he or she supposedly spends
the day writing. At noon, a waiter from the main lodge
brings these fledgling Hemingways and Cathers a box lunch
and puts it on the front stoop of the cottage. Very quietly puts
it on the stoop, so as not to disturb the creative trance of the
cabin’s occupant. One room of each cabin is the writing
room. In the other is a cot for that all-important afternoon
nap . . . or, perhaps, for a revivifying bounce with one of the
other attendees.
In the evening, all members of the colony gather in the
lodge for dinner and intoxicating conversation with the writers in residence. Later, before a roaring fire in the parlor,
marshmallows are toasted, popcorn is popped, wine is drunk,
231

Stephen King

and the stories of the colony attendees are read aloud and
then critiqued.
To me, this sounded like an absolutely enchanted writing
environment. I especially liked the part about having your
lunch left at the front door, deposited there as quietly as the
tooth fairy deposits a quarter under a kid’s pillow. I imagine it
appealed because it’s so far from my own experience, where
the creative flow is apt to be stopped at any moment by a
message from my wife that the toilet is plugged up and would
I try to fix it, or a call from the office telling me that I’m in
imminent danger of blowing yet another dental appointment. At times like that I’m sure all writers feel pretty much
the same, no matter what their skill and success level: God, if
only I were in the right writing environment, with the right understanding people, I just KNOW I could be penning my masterpiece.
In truth, I’ve found that any day’s routine interruptions
and distractions don’t much hurt a work in progress and
may actually help it in some ways. It is, after all, the dab of
grit that seeps into an oyster’s shell that makes the pearl, not
pearl-making seminars with other oysters. And the larger
the work looms in my day—the more it seems like an I hafta
instead of just an I wanna—the more problematic it can
become. One serious problem with writers’ workshops is that
I hafta becomes the rule. You didn’t come, after all, to wander
lonely as a cloud, experiencing the beauty of the woods or the
grandeur of the mountains. You’re supposed to be writing,
dammit, if only so that your colleagues will have something to
critique as they toast their goddam marshmallows there in the
main lodge. When, on the other hand, making sure the kid
gets to his basketball camp on time is every bit as important
as your work in progress, there’s a lot less pressure to produce.
And what about those critiques, by the way? How valuable
232

On Writing

are they? Not very, in my experience, sorry. A lot of them are
maddeningly vague. I love the feeling of Peter’s story, someone
may say. It had something . . . a sense of I don’t know . . . there’s a
loving kind of you know . . . I can’t exactly describe it . . .
Other writing-seminar gemmies include I felt like the tone
thing was just kind of you know; The character of Polly seemed
pretty much stereotypical; I loved the imagery because I could see
what he was talking about more or less perfectly.
And, instead of pelting these babbling idiots with their
own freshly toasted marshmallows, everyone else sitting
around the fire is often nodding and smiling and looking
solemnly thoughtful. In too many cases the teachers and writers
in residence are nodding, smiling, and looking solemnly
thoughtful right along with them. It seems to occur to few of
the attendees that if you have a feeling you just can’t describe,
you might just be, I don’t know, kind of like, my sense of it is,
maybe in the wrong fucking class.
Non-specific critiques won’t help when you sit down to
your second draft, and may hurt. Certainly none of the comments above touch on the language of your piece, or its narrative sense; these comments are just wind, offering no factual
input at all.
Also, daily critiques force you to write with the door constantly open, and in my mind that sort of defeats the purpose. What good does it do you to have the waiter tiptoe
soundlessly up to the stoop of your cabin with your lunch
and then tiptoe away with equal solicitous soundlessness, if
you are reading your current work aloud every night (or
handing it out on Xeroxed sheets) to a group of would-be
writers who are telling you they like the way you handle tone
and mood but want to know if Dolly’s cap, the one with the
bells on it, is symbolic? The pressure to explain is always on,
233

Stephen King

and a lot of your creative energy, it seems to me, is therefore
going in the wrong direction. You find yourself constantly
questioning your prose and your purpose when what you
should probably be doing is writing as fast as the Gingerbread Man runs, getting that first draft down on paper while
the shape of the fossil is still bright and clear in your mind.
Too many writing classes make Wait a minute, explain what
you meant by that a kind of bylaw.
In all fairness, I must admit to a certain prejudice here:
one of the few times I suffered a full-fledged case of writer’s
block was during my senior year at the University of Maine,
when I was taking not one but two creative-writing courses
(one was the seminar in which I met my future wife, so it can
hardly be counted as a dead loss). Most of my fellow students
that semester were writing poems about sexual yearning or
stories in which moody young men whose parents did not
understand them were preparing to go off to Vietnam. One
young woman wrote a good deal about the moon and her
menstrual cycle; in these poems the moon always appeared as
th m’n. She could not explain just why this had to be, but we
all kind of felt it: th m’n, yeah, dig it, sister.
I brought poems of my own to class, but back in my dorm
room was my dirty little secret: the half-completed manuscript of a novel about a teenage gang’s plan to start a raceriot. They would use this for cover while ripping off two
dozen loan-sharking operations and illegal drug-rings in the
city of Harding, my fictional version of Detroit (I had never
been within six hundred miles of Detroit, but I didn’t let that
stop or even slow me down). This novel, Sword in the Darkness,
seemed very tawdry to me when compared to what my fellow
students were trying to achieve; which is why, I suppose, I
never brought any of it to class for a critique. The fact that it
234

On Writing

was also better and somehow truer than all my poems about
sexual yearning and post-adolescent angst only made things
worse. The result was a four-month period in which I could
write almost nothing at all. What I did instead was drink
beer, smoke Pall Malls, read John D. MacDonald paperbacks,
and watch afternoon soap operas.
Writing courses and seminars do offer at least one undeniable benefit: in them, the desire to write fiction or poetry is
taken seriously. For aspiring writers who have been looked
upon with pitying condescension by their friends and relatives (“You better not quit your day job just yet!” is a popular
line, usually delivered with a hideous Bob’s-yer-uncle grin),
this is a wonderful thing. In writing classes, if nowhere else,
it is entirely permissible to spend large chunks of your time
off in your own little dreamworld. Still—do you really need
permission and a hall-pass to go there? Do you need someone
to make you a paper badge with the word WRITER on it before
you can believe you are one? God, I hope not.
Another argument in favor of writing courses has to do
with the men and women who teach them. There are thousands of talented writers at work in America, and only a few
of them (I think the number might be as low as five per
cent) can support their families and themselves with their
work. There’s always some grant money available, but it’s
never enough to go around. As for government subsidies for
creative writers, perish the thought. Tobacco subsidies, sure.
Research grants to study the motility of unpreserved bull
sperm, of course. Creative-writing subsidies, never. Most voters would agree, I think. With the exception of Norman
Rockwell and Robert Frost, America has never much revered
her creative people; as a whole, we’re more interested in commemorative plates from the Franklin Mint and Internet greet235

Stephen King

ing-cards. And if you don’t like it, it’s a case of tough titty said
the kitty, ’cause that’s just the way things are. Americans are
a lot more interested in TV quiz shows than in the short fiction of Raymond Carver.
The solution for a good many underpaid creative writers is
to teach what they know to others. This can be a nice thing,
and it’s nice when beginning writers have a chance to meet
with and listen to veteran writers they may have long
admired. It’s also great when writing classes lead to business
contacts. I got my first agent, Maurice Crain, courtesy of my
sophomore comp teacher, the noted regional short story
writer Edwin M. Holmes. After reading a couple of my stories
in Eh-77 (a comp class emphasizing fiction), Professor Holmes
asked Crain if he would look at a selection of my work. Crain
agreed, but we never had much of an association—he was in
his eighties, unwell, and died shortly after our first correspondence. I can only hope it wasn’t my initial batch of stories
that killed him.
You don’t need writing classes or seminars any more than
you need this or any other book on writing. Faulkner learned
his trade while working in the Oxford, Mississippi, post
office. Other writers have learned the basics while serving in
the Navy, working in steel mills, or doing time in America’s
finer crossbar hotels. I learned the most valuable (and commercial) part of my life’s work while washing motel sheets
and restaurant tablecloths at the New Franklin Laundry in
Bangor. You learn best by reading a lot and writing a lot, and
the most valuable lessons of all are the ones you teach yourself. These lessons almost always occur with the study door
closed. Writing-class discussions can often be intellectually
stimulating and great fun, but they also often stray far afield
from the actual nuts-and-bolts business of writing.
236

On Writing

Still, I suppose you might end up in a version of that sylvan writer’s colony in East Is East: your own little cottage in
the pines, complete with word processor, fresh disks (what is
so delicately exciting to the imagination as a box of fresh
computer disks or a ream of blank paper?), the cot in the
other room for that afternoon nap, and the lady who tiptoes
to your stoop, leaves your lunch, and then tiptoes away
again. That would be okay, I guess. If you got a chance to
participate in a deal like that, I’d say go right ahead. You
might not learn The Magic Secrets of Writing (there aren’t
any—bummer, huh?), but it would certainly be a grand
time, and grand times are something I’m always in favor of.

– 15 –
Other than Where do you get your ideas?, the questions any
publishing writer hears most frequently from those who
want to publish are How do you get an agent? and How do you
make contact with people in the world of publishing?
The tone in which these questions are asked is often bewildered, sometimes chagrined, and frequently angry. There is a
commonly held suspicion that most newcomers who actually
succeed in getting their books published broke through
because they had an in, a contact, a rabbi in the business. The
underlying assumption is that publishing is just one big,
happy, incestuously closed family.
It’s not true. Neither is it true that agents are a snooty,
superior bunch that would die before allowing their
ungloved fingers to touch an unsolicited manuscript. (Well
okay, yeah, there are a few like that.) The fact is that agents,
publishers, and editors are all looking for the next hot writer
237

Stephen King

who can sell a lot of books and make lots of money . . . and
not just the next hot young writer, either; Helen Santmyer
was in a retirement home when she published . . . And Ladies
of the Club. Frank McCourt was quite a bit younger when he
published Angela’s Ashes, but he’s still no spring chicken.
As a young man just beginning to publish some short fiction in the t&a magazines, I was fairly optimistic about my
chances of getting published; I knew that I had some game,
as the basketball players say these days, and I also felt that
time was on my side; sooner or later the best-selling writers
of the sixties and seventies would either die or go senile,
making room for newcomers like me.
Still, I was aware that I had worlds to conquer beyond the
pages of Cavalier, Gent, and Juggs. I wanted my stories to find
the right markets, and that meant finding a way around the
troubling fact that a good many of the best-paying ones (Cosmopolitan, for instance, which at that time published lots of
short stories) wouldn’t look at unsolicited fiction. The answer,
it seemed to me, was to have an agent. If my fiction was good,
I thought in my unsophisticated but not entirely illogical
way, an agent would solve all my problems.
I didn’t discover until much later that not all agents are
good agents, and that a good agent is useful in many other
ways than getting the fiction editor at Cosmo to look at your
short stories. But as a young man I did not yet realize that
there are people in the publishing world—more than a few,
actually—who would steal the pennies off a dead man’s eyes.
For me, that didn’t really matter, because before my first
couple of novels actually succeeded in finding an audience, I
had little to steal.
You should have an agent, and if your work is salable, you
will have only a moderate amount of trouble finding one.
238

On Writing

You’ll probably be able to find one even if your work isn’t salable, as long as it shows promise. Sports agents represent
minor leaguers who are basically playing for meal-money, in
hopes that their young clients will make it to the bigs; for the
same reason, literary agents are often willing to handle writers with only a few publishing credits. You’ll very likely find
someone to handle your work even if your publishing credits
are limited strictly to the “little magazines,” which pay only
in copies—these magazines are often regarded by agents and
book publishers as proving-grounds for new talent.
You must begin as your own advocate, which means reading the magazines publishing the kind of stuff you write. You
should also pick up the writers’ journals and buy a copy of
Writer’s Market, the most valuable of tools for the writer new
to the marketplace. If you’re really poor, ask someone to give
it to you for Christmas. Both the mags and WM (it’s a whopper of a volume, but reasonably priced) list book and magazine publishers, and include thumbnail descriptions of the
sort of stories each market uses. You’ll also find the most salable lengths and the names of editorial staffs.
As a beginning writer, you’ll be most interested in the “little magazines,” if you’re writing short stories. If you’re writing or have written a novel, you’ll want to note the lists of
literary agents in the writing magazines and in Writer’s Market. You may also want to add a copy of the LMP (Literary
Market Place) to your reference shelf. You need to be canny,
careful, and assiduous in your search for an agent or a publisher, but—this bears repeating—the most important thing
you can do for yourself is read the market. Looking at the
thumbnail rundowns in Writer’s Digest may help (“. . . publishes mostly mainstream fiction, 2,000–4,000 words, steer
clear of stereotyped characters and hackneyed romance situ239

Stephen King

ations”), but a thumbnail is, leave us face it, just a thumbnail. Submitting stories without first reading the market is
like playing darts in a dark room—you might hit the target
every now and then, but you don’t deserve to.
Here is the story of an aspiring writer I’ll call Frank. Frank
is actually a composite of three young writers I know, two
men and one woman. All have enjoyed some success in their
twenties as writers; none, as of this writing, are driving RollsRoyces. All three will probably break through, which is to
say that by the age of forty, I believe, all three will be publishing regularly (and probably one will have a drinking
problem).
The three faces of Frank all have different interests and
write in different styles and voices, but their approaches to
the hurdles between them and becoming published writers
are similar enough for me to feel comfortable about putting
them together. I also feel that other beginning writers—you,
for instance, dear Reader—could do worse than follow in
Frank’s footsteps.
Frank was an English major (you don’t have to be an
English major to become a writer, but it sure doesn’t hurt)
who began submitting his stories to magazines as a college
student. He took several creative-writing courses, and many
of the magazines to which he made submissions were recommended to him by his creative-writing teachers. Recommended or not, Frank carefully read the stories in each
magazine, and submitted his own stories according to his
sense of where each would fit best. “For three years I read
every story Story magazine published,” he says, then laughs.
“I may be the only person in America who can make that
statement.”
Careful reading or not, Frank didn’t publish any stories in
240

On Writing

those markets while attending college, although he did publish half a dozen or so in the campus literary magazine (we’ll
call it The Quarterly Pretension). He received personal notes of
rejection from readers at several of the magazines to which he
submitted, including Story (the female version of Frank said,
“They owed me a note!”) and The Georgia Review. During this
time Frank subscribed to Writer’s Digest and The Writer, reading them carefully and paying attention to articles about
agents and the accompanying agency lists. He circled the
names of several who mentioned literary interests he felt he
shared. Frank took particular note of agents who talked
about liking stories of “high conflict,” an arty way of saying
suspense stories. Frank is attracted to suspense stories, also to
stories of crime and the supernatural.
A year out of college, Frank gets his first acceptance letter—oh happy day. It is from a little magazine available at a
few newsstands but mostly by subscription; let’s call it
Kingsnake. The editor offers to buy Frank’s twelve-hundredword vignette, “The Lady in the Trunk,” for twenty-five dollars plus a dozen cc’s—contributor’s copies. Frank is, of
course, delirious; way past Cloud Nine. All the relatives get
a call, even the ones he doesn’t like (especially the ones he
doesn’t like, is my guess). Twenty-five bucks won’t pay the
rent, won’t even buy a week’s worth of groceries for Frank
and his wife, but it’s a validation of his ambition, and that—
any newly published writer would agree, I think—is priceless: Someone wants something I did! Yippee! Nor is that the only
benefit. It is a credit, a small snowball which Frank will now
begin rolling downhill, hoping to turn it into a snow-boulder
by the time it gets to the bottom.
Six months later, Frank sells another story to a magazine
called Lodgepine Review (like Kingsnake, Lodgepine is a compos241

Stephen King

ite). Only “sell” is probably too strong a word; proposed payment for Frank’s “Two Kinds of Men” is twenty-five contributor’s copies. Still, it’s another credit. Frank signs the
acceptance form (loving that line beneath the blank for his
signature almost to death—PROPRIETOR OF THE WORK, by God!)
and sends it back the following day.
Tragedy strikes a month later. It comes in the form of a
form letter, the salutation of which reads Dear Lodgepine
Review Contributor. Frank reads it with a sinking heart. A
grant was not renewed, and Lodgepine Review has gone to that
great writer’s workshop in the sky. The forthcoming summer
issue will be the last. Frank’s story, unfortunately, was slated
for fall. The letter closes by wishing Frank good luck in placing his story elsewhere. In the lower lefthand corner, someone has scribbled four words: AWFULLY SORRY about this.
Frank is AWFULLY SORRY, too (after getting loaded on cheap
wine and waking up with cheap wine hangovers, he and his
wife are SORRIER STILL), but his disappointment doesn’t prevent
him from getting his almost-published short story right back
into circulation. At this point he has half a dozen of them
making the rounds. He keeps a careful record of where they
have been and what sort of response they got during their
visit at each stop. He also keeps track of magazines where he
has established some sort of personal contact, even if that
contact consists of nothing but two scribbled lines and a coffee-stain.
A month after the bad news about Lodgepine Review,
Frank gets some very good news; it arrives in a letter from a
man he’s never heard of. This fellow is the editor of a brandnew little magazine called Jackdaw. He is now soliciting stories for the first issue, and an old school friend of his—editor
of the recently defunct Lodgepine Review, as a matter of
242

On Writing

fact—mentioned Frank’s cancelled story. If Frank hasn’t
placed it, the Jackdaw editor would certainly like a look. No
promises, but . . .
Frank doesn’t need promises; like most beginning writers,
all he needs is a little encouragement and an unlimited supply of take-out pizza. He mails the story off with a letter of
thanks (and a letter of thanks to the ex–Lodgepine editor, of
course). Six months later “Two Kinds of Men” appears in the
premiere issue of Jackdaw. The Old Boy Network, which
plays as large a part in publishing as it does in many other
white-collar/pink-collar businesses, has triumphed again.
Frank’s pay for this story is fifteen dollars, ten contributor’s
copies, and another all-important credit.
In the next year, Frank lands a job teaching high school
English. Although he finds it extremely difficult to teach literature and correct student themes in the daytime and then
work on his own stuff at night, he continues to do so, writing
new short stories and getting them into circulation, collecting rejection slips and occasionally “retiring” stories he’s sent
to all the places he can think of. “They’ll look good in my collection when it finally comes out,” he tells his wife. Our hero
has also picked up a second job, writing book and film
reviews for a newspaper in a nearby city. He’s a busy, busy
boy. Nevertheless, in the back of his mind, he has begun to
think about writing a novel.
When asked what is the most important thing for a young
writer who’s just beginning to submit his or her fiction to
remember, Frank pauses only a few seconds before replying,
“Good presentation.”
Say what?
He nods. “Good presentation, absolutely. When you send
your story out, there ought to be a very brief cover-letter on
243

Stephen King

top of the script, telling the editor where you’ve published
other stories and just a line or two on what this one’s about.
And you should close by thanking him for the reading.
That’s especially important.
“You should submit on a good grade of white bond paper—
none of that slippery erasable stuff. Your copy should be double-spaced, and on the first page you should put your address
in the upper lefthand corner—it doesn’t hurt to include your
telephone number, too. In the righthand corner, put an
approximate word-count.” Frank pauses, laughs, and says:
“Don’t cheat, either. Most magazine editors can tell how long
a story is just by looking at the print and riffling the pages.”
I’m still a bit surprised at Frank’s answer; I expected
something that was a little less nuts-and-bolts.
“Nah,” he says. “You get practical in a hurry once you’re
out of school and trying to find a place for yourself in the
business. The very first thing I learned was that you don’t get
any kind of hearing at all unless you go in looking like a professional.” Something in his tone makes me think he believes
I’ve forgotten a lot about how tough things are at the entrylevel, and perhaps he’s right. It’s been almost forty years
since I had a stack of rejection-slips pinned to a spike in my
bedroom, after all. “You can’t make them like your story,”
Frank finishes, “but you can at least make it easy for them to
try to like it.”
As I write this, Frank’s own story is still a work in progress,
but his future looks bright. He has published a total of six
shorts now, and won a fairly prestigious prize for one of
them—we’ll call it the Minnesota Young Writers’ Award,
although no part of my Frank composite actually lives in
Minnesota. The cash prize was five hundred dollars, by far his
biggest paycheck for a story. He has begun work on his novel,
244

On Writing

and when it’s finished—in the early spring of 2001, he estimates—a reputable young agent named Richard Chams (also
a pseudonym) has agreed to handle it for him.
Frank got serious about finding an agent at about the
same time he got serious about his novel. “I didn’t want to
put in all that work and then be faced with not knowing how
to sell the damn thing when I was done,” he told me.
Based on his explorations of the LMP and the lists of
agents in Writer’s Market, Frank wrote an even dozen letters,
each exactly the same except for the salutation. Here is the
template:
June 19, 1999
Dear

:

I am a young writer, twenty-eight years old, in
search of an agent. I got your name in a Writer’s
Digest article titled “Agents of the New Wave,” and
thought we might fit each other. I have published six
stories since getting serious about my craft. They are:
“The Lady in the Trunk,” Kingsnake, Winter 1996
($25 plus copies)
“Two Kinds of Men,” Jackdaw, Summer 1997 ($15
plus copies)
“Christmas Smoke,” Mystery Quarterly, Fall 1997
($35)
“Big Thumps, Charlie Takes His Lumps,” Cemetery
Dance, January–February 1998 ($50 plus copies)
“Sixty Sneakers,” Puckerbrush Review, April–May
1998 (copies)

245

Stephen King
“A Long Walk in These ’Yere Woods,” Minnesota
Review, Winter 1998–1999 ($70 plus copies)
I would be happy to send any of these stories (or
any of the half dozen or so I’m currently flogging
around) for you to look at, if you’d like. I’m particularly proud of “A Long Walk in These ’Yere Woods,”
which won the Minnesota Young Writers’ Award. The
plaque looks good on our living room wall, and the
prize money—$500—looked excellent for the week or
so it was actually in our bank account (I have been
married for four years; my wife, Marjorie, and I teach
school).
The reason I’m seeking representation now is that
I’m at work on a novel. It’s a suspense story about a
man who gets arrested for a series of murders which
occurred in his little town twenty years before. The
first eighty pages or so are in pretty good shape, and
I’d also be delighted to show you these.
Please be in touch and tell me if you’d like to see
some of my material. In the meantime, thank you for
taking the time to read my letter.
Sincerely yours,

Frank included his telephone number as well as his address,
and one of his target agents (not Richard Chams) actually
called to chat. Three wrote back asking to look at the prizewinning story about the hunter lost in the woods. Half a
dozen asked to see the first eighty pages of his novel. The
response was big, in other words—only one agent to whom
he wrote expressed no interest in Frank’s work, citing a full
roster of clients. Yet outside of his slight acquaintances in the
246

On Writing

world of the “little magazines,” Frank knows absolutely
nobody in the publishing business—has not a single personal contact.
“It was amazing,” he says, “absolutely amazing. I expected
to take whoever wanted to take me—if anybody did—and
count myself lucky. Instead, I got to pick and choose.” He
puts down his bumper crop of possible agents to several
things. First, the letter he sent around was literate and wellspoken (“It took four drafts and two arguments with my
wife to get that casual tone just right,” Frank says). Second, he
could supply an actual list of published short stories, and a
fairly substantial one. No big money, but the magazines were
reputable. Third, there was the prize-winner. Frank thinks
that may have been key. I don’t know if it was or not, but it
certainly didn’t hurt.
Frank was also intelligent enough to ask Richard Chams
and all the other agents he queried for a list of their bona
fides—not a list of clients (I don’t know if an agent who gave
out the names of his clients would even be ethical), but a list
of the publishers to whom the agent had sold books and the
magazines to which he had sold short stories. It’s easy to con
a writer who’s desperate for representation. Beginning writers need to remember that anyone with a few hundred dollars to invest can place an ad in Writer’s Digest, calling himself
or herself a literary agent—it isn’t as if you have to pass a bar
exam, or anything.
You should be especially wary of agents who promise to
read your work for a fee. A few such agents are reputable (the
Scott Meredith Agency used to read for fees; I don’t know if
they still do or not), but all too many are unscrupulous fucks.
I’d suggest that if you’re that anxious to get published, you
skip agent-hunting or query-letters to publishers and go
247

Stephen King

directly to a vanity press. There you will at least get a semblance of your money’s worth.

– 16 –
We’re nearly finished. I doubt if I’ve covered everything you
need to know to become a better writer, and I’m sure I
haven’t answered all your questions, but I have talked about
those aspects of the writing life which I can discuss with at least
some confidence. I must tell you, though, that confidence during the actual writing of this book was a commodity in
remarkably short supply. What I was long on was physical pain
and self-doubt.
When I proposed the idea of a book on writing to my publisher at Scribner, I felt that I knew a great deal about the subject; my head all but burst with the different things I wanted
to say. And perhaps I do know a lot, but some of it turned out
to be dull and most of the rest, I’ve discovered, has more to do
with instinct than with anything resembling “higher thought.”
I found the act of articulating those instinctive truths painfully
difficult. Also, something happened halfway through the writing of On Writing—a life-changer, as they say. I’ll tell you
about it presently. For now, just please know that I did the best
I could.
One more matter needs to be discussed, a matter that
bears directly on that life-changer and one that I’ve touched
on already, but indirectly. Now I’d like to face it head-on. It’s
a question that people ask in different ways—sometimes it
comes out polite and sometimes it comes out rough, but it
always amounts to the same: Do you do it for the money, honey?
The answer is no. Don’t now and never did. Yes, I’ve made
248

On Writing

a great deal of dough from my fiction, but I never set a single
word down on paper with the thought of being paid for it. I
have done some work as favors for friends—logrolling is the
slang term for it—but at the very worst, you’d have to call
that a crude kind of barter. I have written because it fulfilled
me. Maybe it paid off the mortgage on the house and got the
kids through college, but those things were on the side—I
did it for the buzz. I did it for the pure joy of the thing. And
if you can do it for joy, you can do it forever.
There have been times when for me the act of writing has
been a little act of faith, a spit in the eye of despair. The second half of this book was written in that spirit. I gutted it
out, as we used to say when we were kids. Writing is not life,
but I think that sometimes it can be a way back to life. That
was something I found out in the summer of 1999, when a
man driving a blue van almost killed me.

249

ON LIVING:
A POSTSCRIPT

–1–
When we’re at our summer house in western Maine—a house
very much like the one Mike Noonan comes back to in Bag of
Bones—I walk four miles every day, unless it’s pouring down
rain. Three miles of this walk are on dirt roads which wind
through the woods; a mile of it is on Route 5, a two-lane
blacktop highway which runs between Bethel and Fryeburg.
The third week in June of 1999 was an extraordinarily
happy one for my wife and me; our kids, now grown and
scattered across the country, were all home. It was the first
time in nearly six months that we’d all been under the same
roof. As an extra bonus, our first grandchild was in the house,
three months old and happily jerking at a helium balloon
tied to his foot.
On the nineteenth of June, I drove our younger son to the
Portland Jetport, where he caught a flight back to New York
City. I drove home, had a brief nap, and then set out on my
usual walk. We were planning to go en famille to see The General’s Daughter in nearby North Conway, New Hampshire,
that evening, and I thought I just had time to get my walk in
before packing everybody up for the trip.
253

Stephen King

I set out on that walk around four o’clock in the afternoon,
as well as I can remember. Just before reaching the main road
(in western Maine, any road with a white line running down
the middle of it is a main road), I stepped into the woods and
urinated. It was two months before I was able to take
another leak standing up.
When I reached the highway I turned north, walking on
the gravel shoulder, against traffic. One car passed me, also
headed north. About three-quarters of a mile farther along,
the woman driving the car observed a light blue Dodge van
heading south. The van was looping from one side of the road
to the other, barely under the driver’s control. The woman in
the car turned to her passenger when they were safely past
the wandering van and said, “That was Stephen King walking back there. I sure hope that guy in the van doesn’t hit
him.”
Most of the sightlines along the mile of Route 5 which I
walk are good, but there is one stretch, a short steep hill,
where a pedestrian walking north can see very little of what
might be coming his way. I was three-quarters of the way up
this hill when Bryan Smith, the owner and operator of the
Dodge van, came over the crest. He wasn’t on the road;
he was on the shoulder. My shoulder. I had perhaps threequarters of a second to register this. It was just time enough
to think, My God, I’m going to be hit by a schoolbus. I started to
turn to my left. There is a break in my memory here. On the
other side of it I’m on the ground, looking at the back of the
van, which is now pulled off the road and tilted to one side.
This recollection is very clear and sharp, more like a snapshot
than a memory. There is dust around the van’s taillights. The
license plate and the back windows are dirty. I register these
things with no thought that I have been in an accident, or of
254

On Writing

anything else. It’s a snapshot, that’s all. I’m not thinking; my
head has been swopped clean.
There’s another little break in my memory here, and then
I am very carefully wiping palmfuls of blood out of my eyes
with my left hand. When my eyes are reasonably clear, I look
around and see a man sitting on a nearby rock. He has a cane
drawn across his lap. This is Bryan Smith, forty-two years of
age, the man who hit me with his van. Smith has got quite
the driving record; he has racked up nearly a dozen vehiclerelated offenses.
Smith wasn’t looking at the road on the afternoon our
lives came together because his rottweiler had jumped from
the very rear of his van into the back-seat area, where there
was an Igloo cooler with some meat stored inside. The rottweiler’s name is Bullet (Smith has another rottweiler at
home; that one is named Pistol). Bullet started to nose at the
lid of the cooler. Smith turned around and tried to push Bullet away. He was still looking at Bullet and pushing his head
away from the cooler when he came over the top of the knoll;
still looking and pushing when he struck me. Smith told
friends later that he thought he’d hit “a small deer” until he
noticed my bloody spectacles lying on the front seat of his
van. They were knocked from my face when I tried to get out
of Smith’s way. The frames were bent and twisted, but the
lenses were unbroken. They are the lenses I’m wearing now,
as I write this.

–2–
Smith sees I’m awake and tells me help is on the way. He
speaks calmly, even cheerily. His look, as he sits on his rock
255

Stephen King

with his cane drawn across his lap, is one of pleasant commiseration: Ain’t the two of us just had the shittiest luck? it says. He
and Bullet left the campground where they were staying, he
later tells an investigator, because he wanted “some of those
Marzes-bars they have up to the store.” When I hear this little detail some weeks later, it occurs to me that I have nearly
been killed by a character right out of one of my own novels.
It’s almost funny.
Help is on the way, I think, and that’s probably good because
I’ve been in a hell of an accident. I’m lying in the ditch and
there’s blood all over my face and my right leg hurts. I look
down and see something I don’t like: my lap now appears to
be on sideways, as if my whole lower body had been wrenched
half a turn to the right. I look back up at the man with the
cane and say, “Please tell me it’s just dislocated.”
“Nah,” he says. Like his face, his voice is cheery, only
mildly interested. He could be watching all this on TV while
he noshes on one of those Marzes-bars. “It’s broken in five I’d
say maybe six places.”
“I’m sorry,” I tell him—God knows why—and then I’m
gone again for a little while. It isn’t like blacking out; it’s more
as if the film of memory has been spliced here and there.
When I come back this time, an orange-and-white van is
idling at the side of the road with its flashers going. An emergency medical technician—Paul Fillebrown is his name—is
kneeling beside me. He’s doing something. Cutting off my
jeans, I think, although that might have come later.
I ask him if I can have a cigarette. He laughs and says not
hardly. I ask him if I’m going to die. He tells me no, I’m not
going to die, but I need to go to the hospital, and fast. Which
one would I prefer, the one in Norway–South Paris or the one
in Bridgton? I tell him I want to go to Northern Cumberland
256

On Writing

Hospital in Bridgton, because my youngest child—the one I
just took to the airport—was born there twenty-two years
before. I ask Fillebrown again if I’m going to die, and he tells
me again that I’m not. Then he asks me if I can wiggle the
toes on my right foot. I wiggle them, thinking of an old
rhyme my mother used to recite sometimes: This little piggy
went to market, this little piggy stayed home. I should have stayed
home, I think; going for a walk today was a really bad idea.
Then I remember that sometimes when people are paralyzed,
they think they’re moving but really aren’t.
“My toes, did they move?” I ask Paul Fillebrown. He says
they did, a good healthy wiggle. “Do you swear to God?” I
ask him, and I think he does. I’m starting to pass out again.
Fillebrown asks me, very slowly and loudly, bending down
into my face, if my wife is at the big house on the lake. I can’t
remember. I can’t remember where any of my family is, but
I’m able to give him the telephone numbers of both our big
house and the cottage on the far side of the lake where my
daughter sometimes stays. Hell, I could give him my Social
Security number, if he asked. I’ve got all my numbers. It’s
just everything else that’s gone.
Other people are arriving now. Somewhere a radio is
crackling out police calls. I’m put on a stretcher. It hurts, and
I scream. I’m lifted into the back of the EMT truck, and the
police calls are closer. The doors shut and someone up front
says, “You want to really hammer it.” Then we’re rolling.
Paul Fillebrown sits down beside me. He has a pair of clippers and tells me he’s going to have to cut the ring off the
third finger of my right hand—it’s a wedding ring Tabby
gave me in 1983, twelve years after we were actually married. I try to tell Fillebrown that I wear it on my right hand
because the real wedding ring is still on the third finger of
257

Stephen King

my left—the original two-ring set cost me $15.95 at Day’s
Jewelers in Bangor. That first ring only cost eight bucks, in
other words, but it seems to have worked.
Some garbled version of this comes out, probably nothing
Paul Fillebrown can actually understand, but he keeps nodding and smiling as he cuts that second, more expensive,
wedding ring off my swollen right hand. Two months or so
later, I call Fillebrown to thank him; by then I understand
that he probably saved my life by administering the correct
on-scene medical aid and then getting me to the hospital at a
speed of roughly one hundred and ten miles an hour, over
patched and bumpy back roads.
Fillebrown assures me that I’m more than welcome, then
suggests that perhaps someone was watching out for me.
“I’ve been doing this for twenty years,” he tells me over the
phone, “and when I saw the way you were lying in the ditch,
plus the extent of the impact injuries, I didn’t think you’d
make it to the hospital. You’re a lucky camper to still be with
the program.”
The extent of the impact injuries is such that the doctors
at Northern Cumberland Hospital decide they cannot treat
me there; someone summons a LifeFlight helicopter to take
me to Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston. At this
point my wife, older son, and daughter arrive. The kids are
allowed a brief visit; my wife is allowed to stay longer. The
doctors have assured her that I’m banged up, but I’ll make it.
The lower half of my body has been covered. She isn’t
allowed to look at the interesting way my lap has shifted
around to the right, but she is allowed to wash the blood off
my face and pick some of the glass out of my hair.
There’s a long gash in my scalp, the result of my collision
with Bryan Smith’s windshield. This impact came at a point
258

On Writing

less than two inches from the steel driver’s-side support post.
Had I struck that, I likely would have been killed or rendered
permanently comatose, a vegetable with legs. Had I struck
the rocks jutting out of the ground beyond the shoulder of
Route 5, I likely also would have been killed or permanently
paralyzed. I didn’t hit them; I was thrown over the van and
fourteen feet in the air, but landed just shy of the rocks.
“You must have pivoted to the left just a little at the last
second,” Dr. David Brown tells me later. “If you hadn’t, we
wouldn’t be having this conversation.”
The LifeFlight helicopter lands in the parking lot of Northern Cumberland Hospital, and I am wheeled out to it. The
sky is very bright, very blue. The clatter of the helicopter’s
rotors is very loud. Someone shouts into my ear, “Ever been in
a helicopter before, Stephen?” The speaker sounds jolly, all
excited for me. I try to answer yes, I’ve been in a helicopter
before—twice, in fact—but I can’t. All at once it’s very tough
to breathe.
They load me into the helicopter. I can see one brilliant
wedge of blue sky as we lift off; not a cloud in it. Beautiful.
There are more radio voices. This is my afternoon for hearing
voices, it seems. Meanwhile, it’s getting even harder to breathe.
I gesture at someone, or try to, and a face bends upside down
into my field of vision.
“Feel like I’m drowning,” I whisper.
Somebody checks something, and someone else says, “His
lung has collapsed.”
There’s a rattle of paper as something is unwrapped, and
then the someone else speaks into my ear, loudly so as to be
heard over the rotors. “We’re going to put a chest tube in
you, Stephen. You’ll feel some pain, a little pinch. Hold on.”
It’s been my experience (learned when I was just a wee lad
259

Stephen King

with infected ears) that if a medical person tells you you’re
going to feel a little pinch, they’re going to hurt you really
bad. This time it isn’t as bad as I expected, perhaps because
I’m full of painkiller, perhaps because I’m on the verge of
passing out again. It’s like being thumped very high up on the
right side of the chest by someone holding a short sharp
object. Then there’s an alarming whistle in my chest, as if I’ve
sprung a leak. In fact, I suppose I have. A moment later the
soft in-out of normal respiration, which I’ve listened to my
whole life (mostly without being aware of it, thank God), has
been replaced by an unpleasant shloop-shloop-shloop sound. The
air I’m taking in is very cold, but it’s air, at least, air, and I
keep breathing it. I don’t want to die. I love my wife, my kids,
my afternoon walks by the lake. I also love to write; I have a
book on writing that’s sitting back home on my desk, halffinished. I don’t want to die, and as I lie in the helicopter looking out at the bright blue summer sky, I realize that I am
actually lying in death’s doorway. Someone is going to pull me
one way or the other pretty soon; it’s mostly out of my hands.
All I can do is lie there, look at the sky, and listen to my thin,
leaky breathing: shloop-shloop-shloop.
Ten minutes later we set down on the concrete landing
pad at CMMC. To me, it seems to be at the bottom of a concrete well. The blue sky is blotted out and the whap-whapwhap of the helicopter rotors becomes magnified and echoey,
like the clapping of giant hands.
Still breathing in great leaky gulps, I am lifted out of the
helicopter. Someone bumps the stretcher and I scream.
“Sorry, sorry, you’re okay, Stephen,” someone says—when
you’re badly hurt, everyone calls you by your first name,
everyone is your pal.
“Tell Tabby I love her very much,” I say as I am first lifted
260

On Writing

and then wheeled, very fast, down some sort of descending
concrete walkway. All at once I feel like crying.
“You can tell her that yourself,” the someone says. We go
through a door; there is air-conditioning and lights flowing
past overhead. Speakers issue pages. It occurs to me, in a
muddled sort of way, that an hour before I was taking a walk
and planning to pick some berries in a field that overlooks
Lake Kezar. I wouldn’t pick for long, though; I’d have to be
home by five-thirty because we were all going to the movies.
The General’s Daughter, starring John Travolta. Travolta was
in the movie made out of Carrie, my first novel. He played
the bad guy. That was a long time ago.
“When?” I ask. “When can I tell her?”
“Soon,” the voice says, and then I pass out again. This
time it’s no splice but a great big whack taken out of the
memory-film; there are a few flashes, confused glimpses of
faces and operating rooms and looming X-ray machinery;
there are delusions and hallucinations fed by the morphine
and Dilaudid being dripped into me; there are echoing voices
and hands that reach down to paint my dry lips with swabs
that taste of peppermint. Mostly, though, there is darkness.

–3–
Bryan Smith’s estimate of my injuries turned out to be conservative. My lower leg was broken in at least nine places—
the orthopedic surgeon who put me together again, the
formidable David Brown, said that the region below my
right knee had been reduced to “so many marbles in a sock.”
The extent of those lower-leg injuries necessitated two deep
incisions—they’re called medial and lateral fasciotomies—to
261

Stephen King

release the pressure caused by the exploded tibia and also to
allow blood to flow back into the lower leg. Without the fasciatomies (or if the fasciotomies had been delayed), it probably would have been necessary to amputate the leg. My right
knee itself was split almost directly down the middle; the
technical term for the injury is “comminuted intra-articular
tibial fracture.” I also suffered an acetabular fracture of the
right hip—a serious derailment, in other words—and an
open femoral intertrochanteric fracture in the same area. My
spine was chipped in eight places. Four ribs were broken. My
right collarbone held, but the flesh above it was stripped raw.
The laceration in my scalp took twenty or thirty stitches.
Yeah, on the whole I’d say Bryan Smith was a tad conservative.

–4–
Mr. Smith’s driving behavior in this case was eventually
examined by a grand jury, who indicted him on two counts:
driving to endanger (pretty serious) and aggravated assault
(very serious, the kind of thing that means jail time). After
due consideration, the District Attorney responsible for prosecuting such cases in my little corner of the world allowed
Smith to plead out to the lesser charge of driving to endanger. He received six months of county jail time (sentence suspended) and a year’s suspension of his privilege to drive. He
was also put on probation for a year with restrictions on
other motor vehicles, such as snowmobiles and ATVs. It is
conceivable that Bryan Smith could be legally back on the
road in the fall or winter of 2001.

David Brown put my leg back together in five marathon
surgical procedures that left me thin, weak, and nearly at the
end of my endurance. They also left me with at least a fighting chance to walk again. A large steel and carbon-fiber
apparatus called an external fixator was clamped to my leg.
Eight large steel pegs called Schanz pins run through the
fixator and into the bones above and below my knee. Five
smaller steel rods radiate out from the knee. These look sort
of like a child’s drawing of sunrays. The knee itself was locked
in place. Three times a day, nurses would unwrap the smaller
pins and the much larger Schanz pins and swab the holes out
with hydrogen peroxide. I’ve never had my leg dipped in
kerosene and then lit on fire, but if that ever happens, I’m
sure it will feel quite a bit like daily pin-care.
I entered the hospital on June nineteenth. Around the
twenty-fifth I got up for the first time, staggering three steps
to a commode, where I sat with my hospital johnny in my lap
and my head down, trying not to weep and failing. You try to
tell yourself that you’ve been lucky, most incredibly lucky, and
usually that works because it’s true. Sometimes it doesn’t
work, that’s all. Then you cry.
A day or two after those initial steps, I started physical
therapy. During my first session I managed ten steps in a
downstairs corridor, lurching along with the help of a walker.
One other patient was learning to walk again at the same
time, a wispy eighty-year-old woman named Alice who was
recovering from a stroke. We cheered each other on when we

263

Stephen King

had enough breath to do so. On our third day in the downstairs hall, I told Alice that her slip was showing.
“Your ass is showing, sonnyboy,” she wheezed, and kept
going.
By the Fourth of July I was able to sit up in a wheelchair
long enough to go out to the loading dock behind the hospital and watch some of the fireworks. It was a fiercely hot
night, the streets filled with people eating snacks, drinking
beer and soda, watching the sky. Tabby stood next to me,
holding my hand, as the sky lit up red and green, blue and
yellow. She was staying in a condo apartment across the
street from the hospital, and each morning she brought me
poached eggs and tea. I could use the nourishment, it
seemed. In 1997, after returning from a motorcycle trip
across the Australian desert, I weighed two hundred and sixteen pounds. On the day I was released from Central Maine
Medical Center, I weighed a hundred and sixty-five.
I came home to Bangor on July ninth, after a hospital stay
of three weeks. I began a daily rehab program which includes
stretching, bending, and crutch-walking. I tried to keep my
courage and my spirits up. On August fourth I went back to
CMMC for another operation. Inserting an IV into my arm,
the anesthesiologist said, “Okay, Stephen—you’re going to feel
a little like you just had a couple of cocktails.” I opened my
mouth to tell him that would be interesting, since I hadn’t had
a cocktail in eleven years, but before I could get anything out,
I was gone again. When I woke up this time, the Schanz pins
in my upper thigh were gone. I could bend my knee again. Dr.
Brown pronounced my recovery “on course” and sent me
home for more rehab and physical therapy (those of us undergoing P.T. know that the letters actually stand for Pain and Torture). And in the midst of all this, something else happened.
264

On Writing

On July twenty-fourth, five weeks after Bryan Smith hit me
with his Dodge van, I began to write again.

–6–
I actually began On Writing in November or December of
1997, and although it usually takes me only three months to
finish the first draft of a book, this one was still only halfcompleted eighteen months later. That was because I’d put it
aside in February or March of 1998, not sure how to continue,
or if I should continue at all. Writing fiction was almost as
much fun as it had ever been, but every word of the nonfiction
book was a kind of torture. It was the first book I had put
aside uncompleted since The Stand, and On Writing spent a lot
longer in the desk drawer.
In June of 1999, I decided to spend the summer finishing
the damn writing book—let Susan Moldow and Nan Graham
at Scribner decide if it was good or bad, I thought. I read the
manuscript over, prepared for the worst, and discovered I
actually sort of liked what I had. The road to finishing it
seemed clear-cut, too. I had finished the memoir (“C.V.”),
which attempted to show some of the incidents and lifesituations which made me into the sort of writer I turned out
to be, and I had covered the mechanics—those that seemed
most important to me, at least. What remained to be done
was the key section, “On Writing,” where I’d try to answer
some of the questions I’d been asked in seminars and at speaking engagements, plus all those I wish I’d been asked . . . those
questions about the language.
On the night of June seventeenth, blissfully unaware that
I was now less than forty-eight hours from my little date
265

Stephen King

with Bryan Smith (not to mention Bullet the rottweiler), I
sat down at our dining room table and listed all the questions I wanted to answer, all the points I wanted to address.
On the eighteenth, I wrote the first four pages of the “On
Writing” section. That was where the work still stood in late
July, when I decided I’d better get back to work . . . or at
least try.
I didn’t want to go back to work. I was in a lot of pain,
unable to bend my right knee, and restricted to a walker. I
couldn’t imagine sitting behind a desk for long, even in my
wheelchair. Because of my cataclysmically smashed hip, sitting was torture after forty minutes or so, impossible after an
hour and a quarter. Added to this was the book itself, which
seemed more daunting than ever—how was I supposed to
write about dialogue, character, and getting an agent when
the most pressing thing in my world was how long until the
next dose of Percocet?
Yet at the same time I felt I’d reached one of those crossroads moments when you’re all out of choices. And I had
been in terrible situations before which the writing had
helped me get over—had helped me forget myself for at least
a little while. Perhaps it would help me again. It seemed
ridiculous to think it might be so, given the level of my pain
and physical incapacitation, but there was that voice in the
back of my mind, both patient and implacable, telling me
that, in the words of the Chambers Brothers, Time Has
Come Today. It’s possible for me to disobey that voice, but
very difficult to disbelieve it.
In the end it was Tabby who cast the deciding vote, as she
so often has at crucial moments in my life. I’d like to think
I’ve done the same for her from time to time, because it
seems to me that one of the things marriage is about is cast266

On Writing

ing the tiebreaking vote when you just can’t decide what you
should do next.
My wife is the person in my life who’s most likely to say
I’m working too hard, it’s time to slow down, stay away from
that damn PowerBook for a little while, Steve, give it a rest.
When I told her on that July morning that I thought I’d better go back to work, I expected a lecture. Instead, she asked
me where I wanted to set up. I told her I didn’t know, hadn’t
even thought about it.
She thought about it, then said: “I can rig a table for you in
the back hall, outside the pantry. There are plenty of plugins—you can have your Mac, the little printer, and a fan.”
The fan was certainly a must—it had been a terrifically hot
summer, and on the day I went back to work, the temperature outside was ninety-five. It wasn’t much cooler in the
back hall.
Tabby spent a couple of hours putting things together,
and that afternoon at four o’clock she rolled me out through
the kitchen and down the newly installed wheelchair ramp
into the back hall. She had made me a wonderful little nest
there: laptop and printer connected side by side, table lamp,
manuscript (with my notes from the month before placed
neatly on top), pens, reference materials. Standing on the
corner of the desk was a framed picture of our younger son,
which she had taken earlier that summer.
“Is it all right?” she asked.
“It’s gorgeous,” I said, and hugged her. It was gorgeous.
So is she.
The former Tabitha Spruce of Oldtown, Maine, knows
when I’m working too hard, but she also knows that sometimes it’s the work that bails me out. She got me positioned
at the table, kissed me on the temple, and then left me there
267

Stephen King

to find out if I had anything left to say. It turned out I did, a
little, but without her intuitive understanding that yes, it
was time, I’m not sure either of us would ever have found
that out for sure.
That first writing session lasted an hour and forty minutes, by far the longest period I’d spent sitting upright since
being struck by Smith’s van. When it was over, I was dripping with sweat and almost too exhausted to sit up straight
in my wheelchair. The pain in my hip was just short of apocalyptic. And the first five hundred words were uniquely terrifying—it was as if I’d never written anything before them
in my life. All my old tricks seemed to have deserted me. I
stepped from one word to the next like a very old man finding his way across a stream on a zigzag line of wet stones.
There was no inspiration that first afternoon, only a kind of
stubborn determination and the hope that things would get
better if I kept at it.
Tabby brought me a Pepsi—cold and sweet and good—
and as I drank it I looked around and had to laugh despite
the pain. I’d written Carrie and ’Salem’s Lot in the laundry
room of a rented trailer. The back hall of our house in Bangor
resembled it enough to make me feel almost as if I’d come
full circle.
There was no miraculous breakthrough that afternoon,
unless it was the ordinary miracle that comes with any
attempt to create something. All I know is that the words
started coming a little faster after awhile, then a little faster
still. My hip still hurt, my back still hurt, my leg, too, but
those hurts began to seem a little farther away. I started to
get on top of them. There was no sense of exhilaration, no
buzz—not that day—but there was a sense of accomplishment that was almost as good. I’d gotten going, there was
268

On Writing

that much. The scariest moment is always just before you
start.
After that, things can only get better.

–7–
For me, things have continued to get better. I’ve had two
more operations on my leg since that first sweltering afternoon in the back hall, I’ve had a fairly serious bout of infection, and I continue to take roughly a hundred pills a day,
but the external fixator is now gone and I continue to write.
On some days that writing is a pretty grim slog. On others—
more and more of them as my leg begins to heal and my
mind reaccustoms itself to its old routine—I feel that buzz of
happiness, that sense of having found the right words and
put them in a line. It’s like lifting off in an airplane: you’re on
the ground, on the ground, on the ground . . . and then
you’re up, riding on a magical cushion of air and prince of all
you survey. That makes me happy, because it’s what I was
made to do. I still don’t have much strength—I can do a little less than half of what I used to be able to do in a day—but
I’ve had enough to get me to the end of this book, and for
that I’m grateful. Writing did not save my life—Dr. David
Brown’s skill and my wife’s loving care did that—but it has
continued to do what it always has done: it makes my life a
brighter and more pleasant place.
Writing isn’t about making money, getting famous, getting
dates, getting laid, or making friends. In the end, it’s about
enriching the lives of those who will read your work, and
enriching your own life, as well. It’s about getting up, getting
well, and getting over. Getting happy, okay? Getting happy.

Some of this book—perhaps too much—has been about how
I learned to do it. Much of it has been about how you can do
it better. The rest of it—and perhaps the best of it—is a
permission slip: you can, you should, and if you’re brave
enough to start, you will. Writing is magic, as much the water
of life as any other creative art. The water is free. So drink.
Drink and be filled up.

And Furthermore, Part I:
Door Shut, Door Open

Earlier in this book, when writing about my brief career as a
sports reporter for the Lisbon Weekly Enterprise (I was, in fact,
the entire sports department; a small-town Howard Cosell),
I offered an example of how the editing process works. That
example was necessarily brief, and dealt with nonfiction. The
passage that follows is fiction. It is completely raw, the sort of
thing I feel free to do with the door shut—it’s the story
undressed, standing up in nothing but its socks and undershorts. I suggest that you look at it closely before going on to
the edited version.
The Hotel Story
Mike Enslin was still in the revolving door when he saw
Ostermeyer, the manager of the Hotel Dolphin, sitting in
one of the overstuffed lobby chairs. Mike’s heart sank a
little. Maybe should have brought the damned lawyer along
again, after all, he thought. Well, too late now. And even
if Ostermeyer had decided to throw up another roadblock or two between Mike and room 1408, that wasn’t

271

Stephen King
all bad; it would simply add to the story when he finally
told it.
Ostermeyer saw him, got up, and was crossing the
room with one pudgy hand held out as Mike left the
revolving door. The Dolphin was on Sixty-first Street,
around the corner from Fifth Avenue; small but smart.
A man and woman dressed in evening clothes passed
Mike as he reached out and took Ostermeyer’s hand,
switching his small overnight case to his left hand in
order to do it. The woman was blonde, dressed in
black, of course, and the light, flowery smell of her perfume seemed to summarize New York. On the mezzanine level, someone was playing “Night and Day” in the
bar, as if to underline the summary.
“Mr. Enslin. Good evening.”
“Mr. Ostermeyer. Is there a problem?”
Ostermeyer looked pained. For a moment he glanced
around the small, smart lobby, as if for help. At the
concierge’s stand, a man was discussing theater tickets
with his wife while the concierge himself watched them
with a small, patient smile. At the front desk, a man with
the rumpled look one only got after long hours in Business Class was discussing his reservation with a woman
in a smart black suit that could itself have doubled for
evening wear. It was business as usual at the Hotel Dolphin. There was help for everyone except poor Mr.
Ostermeyer, who had fallen into the writer’s clutches.
“Mr. Ostermeyer?” Mike repeated, feeling a little
sorry for the man.
“No,” Ostermeyer said at last. “No problem. But, Mr.
Enslin . . . could I speak to you for a moment in my
office?”
272

On Writing
So, Mike thought. He wants to try one more time.
Under other circumstances he might have been
impatient. Now he was not. It would help the section
on room 1408, offer the proper ominous tone the readers of his books seemed to crave—it was to be One
Final Warning—but that wasn’t all. Mike Enslin hadn’t
been sure until now, in spite of all the backing and filling; now he was. Ostermeyer wasn’t playing a part.
Ostermeyer was really afraid of room 1408, and what
might happen to Mike there tonight.
“Of course, Mr. Ostermeyer. Should I leave my bag at
the desk, or bring it?”
“Oh, we’ll bring it along, shall we?” Ostermeyer, the
good host, reached for it. Yes, he still held out some
hope of persuading Mike not to stay in the room. Otherwise, he would have directed Mike to the desk . . . or
taken it there himself. “Allow me.”
“I’m fine with it,” Mike said. “Nothing but a change
of clothes and a toothbrush.”
“Are you sure?”
“Yes,” Mike said, holding his eyes. “I’m afraid I am.”
For a moment Mike thought Ostermeyer was going to
give up. He sighed, a little round man in a dark cutaway
coat and a neatly knotted tie, and then he squared his
shoulders again. “Very good, Mr. Enslin. Follow me.”
The hotel manager had seemed tentative in the lobby,
depressed, almost beaten. In his oak-paneled office,
with the pictures of the hotel on the walls (the Dolphin
had opened in October of 1910—Mike might publish
without the benefit of reviews in the journals or the bigcity papers, but he did his research), Ostermeyer

seemed to gain assurance again. There was a Persian
carpet on the floor. Two standing lamps cast a mild yellow light. A desk-lamp with a green lozenge-shaped
shade stood on the desk, next to a humidor. And next to
the humidor were Mike Enslin’s last three books.
Paperback editions, of course; there had been no hardbacks. Yet he did quite well. Mine host has been doing a
little research of his own, Mike thought.
Mike sat down in one of the chairs in front of the
desk. He expected Ostermeyer to sit behind the desk,
where he could draw authority from it, but Ostermeyer
surprised him. He sat in the other chair on what he
probably thought of as the employees’ side of the desk,
crossed his legs, then leaned forward over his tidy little
belly to touch the humidor.
“Cigar, Mr. Enslin? They’re not Cuban, but they’re
quite good.”
“No, thank you. I don’t smoke.”
Ostermeyer’s eyes shifted to the cigarette behind
Mike’s right ear—parked there on a jaunty jut the way
an oldtime wisecracking New York reporter might have
parked his next smoke just below his fedora with the
PRESS tag stuck in the band. The cigarette had become so
much a part of him that for a moment Mike honestly
didn’t know what Ostermeyer was looking at. Then he
remembered, laughed, took it down, looked at it himself, then looked back at Ostermeyer.
“Haven’t had a cigarette in nine years,” he said. “I
had an older brother who died of lung cancer. I quit
shortly after he died. The cigarette behind the ear . . .”
He shrugged. “Part affectation, part superstition, I
guess. Kind of like the ones you sometimes see on peo274

ple’s desks or walls, mounted in a little box with a sign
saying BREAK GLASS IN CASE OF EMERGENCY. I sometimes tell
people I’ll light up in case of nuclear war. Is 1408 a
smoking room, Mr. Ostermeyer? Just in case nuclear
war breaks out?”
“As a matter of fact, it is.”
“Well,” Mike said heartily, “that’s one less worry in
the watches of the night.”
Mr. Ostermeyer sighed again, unamused, but this
one didn’t have the disconsolate quality of his lobbysigh. Yes, it was the room, Mike reckoned. His room.
Even this afternoon, when Mike had come accompanied by Robertson, the lawyer, Ostermeyer had seemed
less flustered once they were in here. At the time Mike
had thought it was partly because they were no longer
drawing stares from the passing public, partly because
Ostermeyer had given up. Now he knew better. It was
the room. And why not? It was a room with good pictures on the walls, a good rug on the floor, and good
cigars—although not Cuban—in the humidor. A lot of
managers had no doubt conducted a lot of business in
here since October of 1910; in its own way it was as
New York as the blonde woman in her black off-theshoulder dress, her smell of perfume and her unarticulated promise of sleek sex in the small hours of the
morning—New York sex. Mike himself was from
Omaha, although he hadn’t been back there in a lot of
years.
“You still don’t think I can talk you out of this idea of
yours, do you?” Ostermeyer asked.
“I know you can’t,” Mike said, replacing the cigarette
behind his ear.

What follows is revised copy of this same opening passage—it’s the story putting on its clothes, combing its hair,
maybe adding just a small dash of cologne. Once these
changes are incorporated into my document, I’m ready to
open the door and face the world.

The Hotel Story
By Stephen King
Mike Enslin was still in the revolving door when he
saw Ostermeyer, the manager of the Hotel Dolphin,
sitting in one of the overstuffed lobby chairs. Mike’s
heart sank a little. Maybe should have brought the
damned lawyer along again, after all, he thought.
Well, too late now. And even if Ostermeyer had
decided to throw up another roadblock or two
between Mike and room 1408, that wasn’t all bad; it
would simply add to the story when he finally told it.
Ostermeyer saw him, got up, and was crossing
the room with one pudgy hand held out as Mike left
the revolving door. The Dolphin was on Sixty-first
Street, around the corner from Fifth Avenue; small
but smart. A man and woman dressed in evening
clothes passed Mike as he reached out and took
Ostermeyer’s hand, switching his small overnight
276

On Writing

case to his left hand in order to do it. The woman
was blonde, dressed in black, of course, and the
light, flowery smell of her perfume seemed to summarize New York. On the mezzanine level, someone
was playing “Night and Day” in the bar, as if to
underline the summary.
“Mr. Enslin. Good evening.”
“Mr. Ostermeyer. Is there a problem?”
Ostermeyer looked pained. For a moment he
glanced around the small, smart lobby, as if for
help. At the concierge’s stand, a man was discussing
theater tickets with his wife while the concierge
himself watched them with a small, patient smile.
At the front desk, a man with the rumpled look one
only got after long hours in Business Class was discussing his reservation with a woman in a smart
black suit that could itself have doubled for evening
wear. It was business as usual at the Hotel Dolphin. There was help for everyone except poor Mr.
Ostermeyer, who had fallen into the writer’s
clutches.
“Mr. Ostermeyer?” Mike repeated, feeling a little
sorry for the man.
277

Stephen King

“No,” Ostermeyer said at last. “No problem. But,
Mr. Enslin . . . could I speak to you for a moment in
my office?”
So, Mike thought. He wants to try one more time.
Under other circumstances he might have been
impatient. Now he was not. It would help the section on room 1408, offer the proper ominous tone
the readers of his books seemed to crave—it was to
be One Final Warning—but that wasn’t all. Mike

dor. A lot of managers had no doubt conducted a
lot of business in here since October of 1910; in its
own way it was as New York as the blonde woman
in her black off-the-shoulder dress, her smell of
perfume and her unarticulated promise of sleek
sex in the small hours of the morning—New York
sex. Mike himself was from Omaha, although he
hadn’t been back there in a lot of years.
“You still don’t think I can talk you out of this
idea of yours, do you?” Ostermeyer asked.
“I know you can’t,” Mike said, replacing the cigarette behind his ear.
The reasons for the majority of the changes are self-evident;
if you flip back and forth between the two versions, I’m confident that you’ll understand almost all of them, and I’m
hopeful that you’ll see how raw the first-draft work of even a
so-called “professional writer” is once you really examine it.
Most of the changes are cuts, intended to speed the story.
I have cut with Strunk in mind—“Omit needless words”—
and also to satisfy the formula stated earlier: 2nd Draft = 1st
Draft – 10%.
I have keyed a few changes for brief explanation:
1. Obviously, “The Hotel Story” is never going to replace
“Killdozer!” or Norma Jean, the Termite Queen as a title. I simply slotted it into the first draft, knowing a better one would
occur as I went along. (If a better title doesn’t occur, an edi282

On Writing

tor will usually supply his or her idea of a better one, and the
results are usually ugly.) I like “1408” because this is a “thirteenth floor” story, and the numbers add up to thirteen.
2. Ostermeyer is a long and gallumphing name. By changing it to Olin via global replace, I was able to shorten my
story by about fifteen lines at a single stroke. Also, by the
time I finished “1408,” I had realized it was probably going to
be part of an audio collection. I would read the stories myself,
and didn’t want to sit there in the little recording booth,
saying Ostermeyer, Ostermeyer, Ostermeyer all day long. So
I changed it.
3. I’m doing a lot of the reader’s thinking for him here.
Since most readers can think for themselves, I felt free to cut
this from five lines to just two.
4. Too much stage direction, too much belaboring of the
obvious, and too much clumsy back story. Out it goes.
5. Ah, here is the lucky Hawaiian shirt. It shows up in the
first draft, but not until about page thirty. That’s too late for
an important prop, so I stuck it up front. There’s an old rule
of theater that goes, “If there’s a gun on the mantel in Act I,
it must go off in Act III.” The reverse is also true; if the main
character’s lucky Hawaiian shirt plays a part at the end of a
story, it must be introduced early. Otherwise it looks like a
deus ex machina (which of course it is).
6. The first-draft copy reads “Mike sat down in one of the
chairs in front of the desk.” Well, duh—where else is he
going to sit? On the floor? I don’t think so, and out it goes.
Also out is the business of the Cuban cigars. This is not only
trite, it’s the sort of thing bad guys are always saying in bad
movies. “Have a cigar! They’re Cuban!” Fuhgeddaboudit!
7. The first- and second-draft ideas and basic information
are the same, but in the second draft, things have been cut to
283

Stephen King

the bone. And look! See that wretched adverb, that “shortly”?
Stomped it, didn’t I? No mercy!
8. And here’s one I didn’t cut . . . not just an adverb but a
Swiftie: “Well,” Mike said heartily . . . But I stand behind
my choice not to cut in this case, would argue that it’s the
exception which proves the rule. “Heartily” has been allowed
to stand because I want the reader to understand that Mike is
making fun of poor Mr. Olin. Just a little, but yes, he’s making fun.
9. This passage not only belabors the obvious but repeats
it. Out it goes. The concept of a person’s feeling comfortable
in one’s own special place, however, seemed to clarify Olin’s
character, and so I added it.
I toyed with the idea of including the entire finished text of
“1408” in this book, but the idea ran counter to my determination to be brief, for once in my life. If you would like to listen to the entire thing, it’s available as part of a three-story
audio collection, Blood and Smoke. You may access a sample on
the Simon and Schuster Web site, http://www.SimonSays.com.
And remember, for our purposes here, you don’t need to finish the story. This is about engine maintenance, not joyriding.

And Furthermore, Part II:
A Booklist

When I talk about writing, I usually offer my audiences an
abbreviated version of the “On Writing” section which forms
the second half of this book. That includes the Prime Rule, of
course: Write a lot and read a lot. In the Q-and-A period
which follows, someone invariably asks: “What do you read?”
I’ve never given a very satisfactory answer to that question, because it causes a kind of circuit overload in my brain.
The easy answer—“Everything I can get my hands on”—is
true enough, but not helpful. The list that follows provides a
more specific answer to that question. These are the best
books I’ve read over the last three or four years, the period
during which I wrote The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, Hearts
in Atlantis, On Writing, and the as-yet-unpublished From a
Buick Eight. In some way or other, I suspect each book in the
list had an influence on the books I wrote.
As you scan this list, please remember that I’m not Oprah
and this isn’t my book club. These are the ones that worked
for me, that’s all. But you could do worse, and a good many
of these might show you some new ways of doing your work.
